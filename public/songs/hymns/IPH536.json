I take its shadow"," to be my hiding-place;","I ask no other sunshine than"," the sunshine of His face;","\f Content to let the world go by,"," to know no gain or loss:"," my sinful self my only shame,"," my glory all – the cross!"]}],"chorus":"","CCLI":"Elizabeth Cecilia Clephane, 1830-1869\nadapted Compilers of Praise! 2000 CCLI 128675"}
