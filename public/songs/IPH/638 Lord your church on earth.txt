Lord Your Church on Earth
Lord, Your Church on earth is
            seeking
  Your renewal from above;
teach us all the art of speaking
 with the accent of Your love.
    We would heed Your great
            commission:
     Go you into every place -
 preach, baptise, fulfil my mission,
serve with love and share my grace.
Freedom give to those in bondage,
  lift the burdens caused by sin.
Give new hope, new strength and
              courage,
 grant release from fears within:
light for darkness, joy for sorrow;
  love for hatred; peace for strife.
   These and countless blessings
               follow
    as the Spirit gives new life.
In the streets of every city where
   the bruised and lonely live,
we will show the Saviour's pity,
   and His longing to forgive.
      In all lands and with all races
    we will serve, and seek to bring
     all the world to render praises,
    Christ, to You, Redeemer, King.
