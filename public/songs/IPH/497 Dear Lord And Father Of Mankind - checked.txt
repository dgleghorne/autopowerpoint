      IPH 497
Dear Lord And Father
    Of Mankind
 Dear Lord and Father of
        mankind,
forgive our foolish ways:
reclothe us in our rightful
          mind;
in purer lives Your service
            find,
in deeper reverence praise,
in deeper reverence praise.
In simple trust like theirs who
            heard,
    beside the Syrian sea,
  the gracious calling of the
            Lord –
let us, like them, obey His
            word:
  ‘Rise up and follow me,
   rise up and follow me!’
O Sabbath rest by Galilee!
  O calm of hills above,
 when Jesus shared on
      bended knee
the silence of eternity
  interpreted by love,
  interpreted by love!
 With that deep hush subduing
               all
   our words and works that
             drown
the tender whisper of Your call,
as noiseless let Your blessing
              fall
   as fell Your manna down,
   as fell Your manna down.
    Drop Your still dews of
            quietness,
  till all our strivings cease;
take from our souls the strain
            and stress,
 and let our ordered lives
          confess
the beauty of Your peace,
the beauty of Your peace.
 Breathe through the heats of
          our desire
Your coolness and Your balm;
 let sense be dumb, let flesh
            retire,
   speak through the earthquake,
             wind and fire,
     O still small voice of calm,
     O still small voice of calm!
