      IPH 59
We Plough The Fields
We plough the fields, and scatter
  the good seed on the land;
   but it is fed and watered
   by God’s almighty hand:
 He sends the snow in winter,
the warmth to swell the grain;
 the breezes and the sunshine
   and soft refreshing rain.
  All good gifts around us
are sent from heaven above:
    then thank the Lord,
      O thank the Lord
       for all His love.
    He only is the maker
 of all things near and far;
He paints the wayside flower,
 He lights the evening star:
the winds and waves obey Him,
    by Him the birds are fed;
 much more, to us His children
    He gives our daily bread.
  All good gifts around us
are sent from heaven above:
    then thank the Lord,
      O thank the Lord
       for all His love.
We thank You, then, our Father,
 for all things bright and good;
 the seed-time and the harvest,
  our life, our health, our food:
      accept the gifts we offer
     for all Your love imparts;
and that which You most welcome
   our humble, thankful hearts!
        All good gifts around us
      are sent from heaven above:
          then thank the Lord,
            O thank the Lord
             for all His love.
