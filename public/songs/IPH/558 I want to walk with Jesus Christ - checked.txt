I want to walk with Jesus Christ
I want to walk with Jesus Christ,
 all the days I live of this life on
              earth,
to give to Him complete control
      of body and of soul:
Follow Him, follow Him, yield
       your life to Him,
He has conquered death, He is
        King of kings.
Accept the joy which He gives to
             those
  who yield their lives to Him.
I want to learn to speak to Him
to pray to Him, confess my sin,
to open my life and let Him in,
   for joy will then be mine:
Follow Him, follow Him, yield
       your life to Him,
He has conquered death, He is
        King of kings.
Accept the joy which He gives to
             those
  who yield their lives to Him.
I want to learn to speak of Him,
my life must show that He lives
             in me,
my deeds, my thoughts, my
    words must speak
  all of His love for me:
Follow Him, follow Him, yield
       your life to Him,
He has conquered death, He is
        King of kings.
Accept the joy which He gives to
             those
  who yield their lives to Him.
I want to learn to read His word,
  for this is how I know the way
to live my life as pleases Him,
      in holiness and joy:
Follow Him, follow Him, yield
       your life to Him,
He has conquered death, He is
        King of kings.
Accept the joy which He gives to
             those
  who yield their lives to Him.
 O Holy Spirit of the Lord,
enter now into my youthful
          heart,
take full control of my selfish will
      and rule in every part:
Follow Him, follow Him, yield
       your life to Him,
He has conquered death, He is
        King of kings.
           Accept the joy which He gives to
                        those
             who yield their lives to Him.
