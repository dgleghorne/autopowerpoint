        IPH 298
O Bless the God of Israel
O bless the God of Israel,
who comes to set us free,
who visits and redeems us
  and grants us liberty.
The prophets spoke of mercy,
   of rescue and release;
 God shall fulfil the promise
 to bring our people peace.
Now from the house of David
  a child of grace is given;
 a Saviour comes among us
  to raise us up to heaven.
  Before Him goes the
        herald -
 forerunner in the way,
the prophet of salvation,
 the messenger of day.
 Where once were fear and
          darkness
   the sun begins to rise -
that dawning of forgiveness
   upon the sinner's eyes,
to guide the feet of pilgrims
  along the paths of peace:
O bless our God and Saviour,
with songs that never cease!
