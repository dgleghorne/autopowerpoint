      IPH 328
O Come All You Faithful
   O Come, all you faithful,
    joyful and triumphant!
 O come now, O come now, to
         Bethlehem!
Come and behold Him, born the
        King of angels:
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
    Christ the Lord!
       God from God,
       Light from light,
He who abhors not the Virgin’s
            womb;
very God, begotten, not created:
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
    Christ the Lord!
    Sing, choirs of angels,
      sing in exultation!
Sing all you citizens of heaven
            above,
‘Glory to God in the highest!’
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
    Christ the Lord!
   Yes, Lord, we greet You
    born for our salvation;
 Jesus, to You be glory given!
Word of the Father now in flesh
           appearing:
         O come, let us adore Him,
         O come, let us adore Him,
         O come, let us adore Him,
             Christ the Lord!
