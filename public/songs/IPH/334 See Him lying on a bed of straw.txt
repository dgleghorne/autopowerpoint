            IPH 334
See Him Lying On A Bed Of Straw
  See Him lying on a bed of straw:
a draughty stable with an open door;
 Mary cradling the Babe she bore –
  the Prince of Glory is His name.
   O now carry me to Bethlehem
   to see the Lord of love again:
Just as poor as was the stable then,
the Prince of Glory when He came.
Star of silver, sweep across the skies,
show where Jesus in the manger lies;
 Shepherds swiftly from your stupor
                  rise
   to see the Saviour of the world!
   O now carry me to Bethlehem
   to see the Lord of love again:
Just as poor as was the stable then,
the Prince of Glory when He came.
 Angels, sing the song you sang,
 sing the glory of God’s gracious
               plan;
Sing that Bethl’em’s little baby can
        be Saviour of us all.
   O now carry me to Bethlehem
   to see the Lord of love again:
Just as poor as was the stable then,
the Prince of Glory when He came.
Mine are riches, from your poverty,
 from Your innocence, eternity;
Mine, forgiveness by Your death for
                me,
   Child of sorrow for my joy.
     O now carry me to Bethlehem
     to see the Lord of love again:
  Just as poor as was the stable then,
  the Prince of Glory when He came.
