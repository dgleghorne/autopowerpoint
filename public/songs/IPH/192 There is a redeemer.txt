There Is A Redeemer
      There is a Redeemer,
     Jesus, God’s own Son,
precious Lamb of God, Messiah,
           Holy One.
   Thank You, O my Father,
     for giving us Your Son,
  and leaving us Your Spirit
till the work on earth is done.
      Jesus, my Redeemer,
     Name above all names,
precious Lamb of God, Messiah,
       O for sinners slain.
   Thank You, O my Father,
     for giving us Your Son,
  and leaving us Your Spirit
till the work on earth is done.
     When I stand in glory,
      I will see His face,
and there I’ll serve my King for
               ever
       in that holy place.
     Thank You, O my Father,
       for giving us Your Son,
    and leaving us Your Spirit
  till the work on earth is done.
