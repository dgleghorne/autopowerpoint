For The Beauty Of The Earth
   For the beauty of the earth,
    for the beauty of the skies,
for the love which from our birth
     over and around us lies,
Christ our God, to You we raise
  this our sacrifice of praise.
    For the beauty of each hour
    of the day and of the night,
hill and vale, and tree and flower,
 sun and moon and stars of light,
Christ our God, to You we raise
  this our sacrifice of praise.
  For the joy of the ear and eye,
for the heart and mind’s delight,
     for the mystic harmony
linking sense to sound and sight,
Christ our God, to You we raise
  this our sacrifice of praise.
   For the joy of the human love,
    brother, sister, parent, child,
friends on earth and friends above,
   pleasures pure and undefiled,
Christ our God, to You we raise
  this our sacrifice of praise.
     For each perfect gift divine
     to our race so freely given,
   joys bestowed by love’s design,
flowers of earth and buds of heaven,
   Christ our God, to You we raise
     this our sacrifice of praise.
