  IPH 8
Day is done
Day is done, but love unfailing dwells
              ever here;
  Shadows fall, but hope, prevailing,
          calms every fear.
   Loving Father, none forsaking,
take our hearts of Love's own making
   Watch our sleeping, guard our
               waking,
           be always near!
Dusk descends, but light unending
     shines through our night
  You are with us, ever lending
       new strength to sight
One in love, your truth confessing
 one in hope of heaven's blessing
May we see, in love's possessing
        love's endless light!
     Eyes will close, but you
             unsleeping
         watch by our side
   Death may come, in love's
            safekeeping
           still we abide
   God of love, all evil quelling
   sin forgiving, fear dispelling
Stay with us, our hearts indwelling
           this eventide.
