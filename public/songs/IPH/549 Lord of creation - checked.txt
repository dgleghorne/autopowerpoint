    IPH 549
Lord Of Creation
 Lord of creation, to You be all
             praise!
Most mighty Your working, most
     wondrous Your ways!
Your glory and might are beyond
           us to tell,
   and yet in the heart of the
      humble You dwell.
Lord of all power, I give You my
               will,
in joyful obedience Your tasks to
              fulfil;
Your bondage is freedom, Your
        service is song,
and, held in Your keeping, my
      weakness is strong.
Lord of all wisdom, I give You
            my mind,
rich truth that surpasses man’s
       knowledge to find;
what eye has not seen and what
       ear has not heard
 is taught by Your Spirit and
    shines from Your word.
Lord of all bounty, I give You my
               heart;
I praise and adore You for all You
              impart,
Your love to inspire me, Your
      counsel to guide,
 Your presence to cheer me,
      whatever betide.
 Lord of all being, I give You my
                 all;
for if I disown You I stumble and
                fall;
    but, sworn in glad service Your
             word to obey,
   and walk in Your freedom to the
            end of the way.
