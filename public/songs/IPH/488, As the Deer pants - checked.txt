As The Deer
As the deer pants for the water,
 so my soul longs after You.
You alone are my heart’s desire
  and I long to worship You.
  You alone are my strength, my
             shield,
to You alone may my spirit yield.
 You alone are my heart’s desire
   and I long to worship You.
 I want You more than gold or
             silver,
     only You can satisfy.
You alone are the real joy-giver
    and the apple of my eye.
  You alone are my strength, my
             shield,
to You alone may my spirit yield.
 You alone are my heart’s desire
   and I long to worship You.
You’re my friend and You are my
             brother,
    even though You are a king.
 I love You more than any other,
   so much more than anything.
     You alone are my strength, my
                shield,
   to You alone may my spirit yield.
    You alone are my heart’s desire
      and I long to worship You.
