   IPH 661
Abide With Me
Abide with me: fast falls the
          eventide;
the darkness deepens: Lord,
       with me abide!
When other helpers fail and
       comforts flee,
Help of the helpless, O abide
          with me.
 Swift to its close ebbs out life’s
             little day;
earth’s joys grow dim, its glories
            pass away;
change and decay in all around I
             see:
You never change, O Lord; abide
           with me.
I need Your presence every passing
              hour;
  what but Your grace can foil the
         tempter’s power?
 Who like Yourself my guide and
        strength can be?
Through cloud and sunshine, Lord,
         abide with me.
I fear no foe, with You at hand to
               bless;
 ills have no weight and tears no
            bitterness.
   Where is death’s sting? Where,
        grave, thy victory?
I triumph still if You abide with me.
Hold, Lord, Your cross before my
          closing eyes;
Shine through the gloom and point
         me to the skies:
     heaven’s morning breaks and
       earth’s vain shadows flee;
 In life, in death, O Lord, abide with
                   me.
