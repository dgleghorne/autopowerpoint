Eternal Father, Strong To Save
 Eternal Father, strong to save,
whose arm restrains the restless
             wave,
who told the mighty ocean deep
its own appointed bounds to keep:
     we cry, O God of majesty,
    for those in peril on the sea.
 O Christ, whose voice the waters
              heard
  and hushed their raging at Your
              word,
who walked across the surging deep,
and in the storm lay calm in sleep:
    we cry, O Lord of Galilee,
   for those in peril on the sea.
 Creator Spirit, by whose breath
 were fashioned sea and sky and
              earth;
who made the stormy chaos cease,
and gave us life and light and peace:
  we cry, O Spirit strong and free,
    for those in peril on the sea.
     O Trinity of love and power,
preserve their lives in dangerâ€™s hour;
  from rock and tempest, flood and
                flame,
   protect them by Your holy name,
     and to Your glory let there be
    glad hymns of praise from land
               and sea.
