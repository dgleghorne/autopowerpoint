   IPH 409
In The Cross
  All my days I will sing this
      song of gladness,
Give my praise to the fountain
         of delights;
For in my helplessness You
       heard my cry,
and waves of mercy poured
      down on my life.
I will trust in the cross of my
            Redeemer,
  I will sing of the blood that
            never fails,
   Of sins forgiven, of
  conscience cleansed,
of death defeated and life
      without end.
 Beautiful Saviour,
Wonderful Counsellor,
 Clothed in majesty,
   Lord of history,
You’re the Way, the Truth,
         the Life.
  Star of the morning,
  glorious in holiness,
you’re the risen one,
heaven’s champion,
  and You reign,
 You reign over all!
 I long to be where the praise
        is never-ending,
yearn to dwell where the glory
          never fades,
Where countless worshippers
    will share one song,
 and cries of ‘Worthy’ will
     honour the Lamb!
 Beautiful Saviour,
Wonderful Counsellor,
 Clothed in majesty,
   Lord of history,
You’re the Way, the Truth,
         the Life.
  Star of the morning,
  Glorious in holiness,
               You’re the risen one,
               heaven’s champion,
                 and You reign,
                You reign over all!
