        IPH 533
Who Is On The Lord’s Side
Who is on the Lord’s side?
Who will serve the King?
Who will be His helpers,
  other lives to bring?
Who will leave the world’s side?
   Who will face the foe?
  Who is on the Lord’s side?
    Who for Him will go?
 By Your call of mercy,
  by Your grace alone,
we are on the Lord’s side,
 Saviour, all Your own.
 Jesus, You have bought us,
    not with gold or gem,
but with Your own life-blood,
      for Your diadem.
With Your blessing filling
  all who come in need,
You have made us willing,
   made us free indeed.
By Your great redemption,
  by Your grace alone,
we are on the Lord’s side,
 Saviour, all Your own.
Fierce may be the conflict,
  strong may be the foe;
 but the King’s own army
   none can overthrow.
Round His standard ranging,
     victory is secure;
 for His truth unchanging
  makes the triumph sure.
   Joyfully enlisting,
  by Your grace alone,
we are on the Lord’s side
 Saviour, all Your own.
   Chosen to be soldiers
      in a hostile land,
chosen, called and faithful,
  for our Captain’s band.
  In His service royal
  let us not grow cold;
  let us then be loyal,
steadfast, true and bold.
            Master, You will keep us
              by Your grace alone,
           always on the Lord’s side,
             Saviour, all Your own.
