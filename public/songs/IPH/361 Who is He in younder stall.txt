        IPH 361
Who is He, in yonder stall
   Who is He, in yonder stall,
at whose feet the shepherds fall?

‘Tis the Lord! O wondrous story!
 ‘Tis the Lord, the King of glory!
    At his feet we humbly fall;
 crown Him, crown Him Lord of
                all!
  Who is He in deep distress,
  fasting in the wilderness?

Tis the Lord! O wondrous story!
‘Tis the Lord, the King of glory!
   At his feet we humbly fall;
crown Him, crown Him Lord of
               all!
 Who is He the gathering throng
greet with loud triumphant song?

Tis the Lord! O wondrous story!
‘Tis the Lord, the King of glory!
   At his feet we humbly fall;
crown Him, crown Him Lord of
               all!
  Lo! At midnight, who is He,
  prays in dark Gethsemane?

Tis the Lord! O wondrous story!
‘Tis the Lord, the King of glory!
   At his feet we humbly fall;
crown Him, crown Him Lord of
               all!
   Who is He on yonder tree
   dies in shame and agony?

Tis the Lord! O wondrous story!
‘Tis the Lord, the King of glory!
   At his feet we humbly fall;
crown Him, crown Him Lord of
               all!
 Who is He that from the grave
comes to heal and help and save?

Tis the Lord! O wondrous story!
‘Tis the Lord, the King of glory!
   At his feet we humbly fall;
crown Him, crown Him Lord of
               all!

       Who is He that from His throne
      rules through all the world alone?

        Tis the Lord! O wondrous story!
        ‘Tis the Lord, the King of glory!
           At his feet we humbly fall;
        crown Him, crown Him Lord of
                       all!
