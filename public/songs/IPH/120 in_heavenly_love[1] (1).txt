    IPH 120
In Heavenly Love
  In heavenly love abiding,
no change my heart shall fear:
 and safe is such confiding,
  for nothing changes here:
the storm may roar around me,
  my heart may low be laid;
my Father's arms surround me,
      how can I be afraid?
Wherever He may guide me
no want shall turn me back;
 my Shepherd is beside me
  and nothing can I lack:
 His wisdom is for ever,
 His sight is never dim;
His love deserts me never
and I will walk with Him.
  Green pastures are before me,
     which yet I have not seen;
 bright skies will soon be over me
where threatening clouds have been:
       my hope I cannot measure,
         my path to life is free;
       my Saviour has my treasure
       and He will walk with me.
