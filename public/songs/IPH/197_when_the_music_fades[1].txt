      IPH 197
When The Music Fades
  When the music fades,all is
         stripped away,
      and I simply come;
longing just to bring something
         that's of worth
   that will bless Your heart.
I'll bring You more than a song,
         for a song in itself
 is not what You have required,
You search much deeper within
 through the way things appear;
  You're looking into my heart.
I'm coming back to the heart of
            worship,
     and it's all about You,
      all about You, Jesus
I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've
             made it,
     when it's all about You,
      all about You, Jesus.
 King of endless worth, no one
         could express
   how much You deserve.
Though I'm weak and poor, all I
        have is Yours,
     every single breath.
I'll bring You more than a song,
         for a song in itself
 is not what You have required.
You search much deeper within
 through the way things appear;
  You're looking into my heart.
I'm coming back to the heart of
            worship,
     and it's all about You,
      all about You, Jesus
 I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've
              made it,
      when it's all about You,
       all about You, Jesus.
