        IPH 291
Come O Long Expected Jesus
  Come, O long-expected Jesus,
  born to set Your people free!
From our fears and sins release us,
Christ in whom our rest shall be.
Israel's strength and consolation,
    born salvation to impart;
   dear desire of every nation,
   joy of every longing heart:
  Born Your people to deliver,
   born a child and yet a king;
   born to reign in us for ever,
now Your gracious kingdom bring.
      By Your own eternal Spirit
      rule in all our hearts alone;
      by Your all-sufficient merit
   raise us to Your glorious throne.


Charles Wesley, 1707-1788     CCLI 128675
