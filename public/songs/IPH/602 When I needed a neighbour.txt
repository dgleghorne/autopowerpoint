When I Needed A Neighbour
 When I needed a neighbour,
were you there, were you there?
 When I needed a neighbour,
       were you there?
And the creed and the colour and
     the name won’t matter,
         were you there?
I was hungry and thirsty, were
  you there, were you there?
I was hungry and thirsty, were
          you there?
And the creed and the colour and
     the name won’t matter,
         were you there?
I was cold, I was naked, were
  you there, were you there?
I was cold, I was naked, were
          you there?
And the creed and the colour and
     the name won’t matter,
         were you there?
When I needed a shelter, were
 you there, were you there?
When I needed a shelter, were
         you there?
And the creed and the colour and
     the name won’t matter,
         were you there?
When I needed a healer, were you
    there, were you there?
When I needed a healer, were you
            there?
And the creed and the colour and
     the name won’t matter,
         were you there?
Wherever you travel, I’ll be there,
          I’ll be there,
wherever you travel, I’ll be there.
And the creed and the colour and
     the name won’t matter,
          I’ll be there!
