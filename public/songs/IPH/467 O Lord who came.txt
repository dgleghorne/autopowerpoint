    IPH 467
O Lord who came
O Lord, who came from realms
             above
the pure celestial fire to impart,
 kindle a flame of sacred love
  upon the alter of my heart.
 There let it for Your glory burn
   with inextinguishable blaze,
and trembling to its source return
  in humble prayer and fervent
               praise.
Jesus, confirm my heartâ€™s desire
to work and speak and think for
               You;
 still let me guard the holy fire,
and still in me Your gift renew.
 Here let me prove Your perfect
               will,
my acts of faith and love repeat,
 till death Your endless mercies
               seal
and make the sacrifice complete!
