My Jesus, My Saviour
   My Jesus, my Saviour,
Lord, there is none like You.
  All of my days I want to
           praise
the wonders of Your mighty
            love.
  My comfort, my shelter,
    tower of refuge and
          strength,
 let every breath, all that I
             am,
never cease to worship You.
 Shout to the Lord all the
    earth, let us sing,
power and majesty, praise
       to the King.
Mountains bow down and
 the seas will roar at the
  sound of Your name.
I sing for joy at the work of
         Your hands,
  for ever I’ll love You, for
        ever I’ll stand.
    Nothing compares to the
     promise I have in You.
