Talk To God
Talk to God and share with Him the
    thoughts you have each day.
Let Him know what’s on your mind –
     He loves to hear you pray.
With ‘Sorry’, ‘Please’ and ‘Thank You’,
     there’s such a lot to say.
   God loves to hear you praying
        at any time of day.
Talk to God and share with Him the
    thoughts you have each day.
Let Him know what’s on your mind –
     He loves to hear you pray.
     In any place you go to
    our Father God is there;
He knows what you are thinking,
   He listens to each prayer.
Talk to God and share with Him the
    thoughts you have each day.
Let Him know what’s on your mind –
     He loves to hear you pray.
