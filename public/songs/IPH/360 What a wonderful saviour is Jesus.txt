What a wonderful Saviour is
          Jesus
 What a wonderful Saviour is
            Jesus,
what a wonderful friend is He,
  for He left all the glory of
           heaven,
   came to earth to die on
           Calvary:
Sing hosanna! Sing hosanna!
 Sing hosanna to the King of
           kings!
Sing hosanna! Sing hosanna!
  Sing hosanna to the King.
 He arose from the grave,
          Hallelujah!
And He lives never more to
             die,
 at the Father’s right hand
         interceding
He will hear and heed our
        faintest cry:
Sing hosanna! Sing hosanna!
 Sing hosanna to the King of
           kings!
Sing hosanna! Sing hosanna!
  Sing hosanna to the King.
  He is coming some day to
          receive us,
we’ll be caught up to heaven
            above,
what a joy it will be to behold
             Him,
sing forever of His grace and
             love.
    Sing hosanna! Sing hosanna!
     Sing hosanna to the King of
               kings!
    Sing hosanna! Sing hosanna!
      Sing hosanna to the King.
