Tell all the world
 Tell all the world of Jesus,
our Saviour, Lord and King;
 and let the whole creation
   of His salvation sing:

    in nature and in grace;
    Creator and Redeemer,
  the Lord of time and space.
   Tell all the world of Jesus,
    that everyone may find
  the joy of His forgiveness –
true peace of heart and mind:
proclaim His perfect goodness,
   His deep, unfailing care;
   His love so rich in mercy,
   a love beyond compare.
Tell all the world of Jesus,
 that everyone may know
  of His almighty triumph
   defeating every foe:
proclaim His coming glory,
  when sin is overthrown
   and He shall reign in
       splendour –
and King upon His throne!
