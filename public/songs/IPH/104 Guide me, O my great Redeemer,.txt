       IPH 104
Guide Me, O My Great
      Redeemer
Guide me, O my great Redeemer,
 pilgrim through this barren land;
 I am weak, but You are mighty,
hold me with your powerful hand:
     Bread of heaven,
     Bread of heaven,
feed me now and evermore!
feed me now and evermore!
 Open now the crystal fountain
 where the healing waters flow;
   let the fiery, cloudy pillar
lead me all my journey through:
       strong Deliverer,
       strong Deliverer,
ever be my strength and shield,
ever be my strength and shield.
  When I tread the verge of Jordan
    bid my anxious fears subside;
Death of death, and hell’s Destruction,
   land me safe on Canaan’s side:
                  songs of praises,
                  songs of praises,
               I will ever sing to You,
               I will ever sing to You.
