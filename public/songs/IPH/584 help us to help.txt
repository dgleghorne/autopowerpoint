            IPH 584
Help us to help each other Lord
   Unless the Lord has built
           the house
     it must be built again;
except the Lorddefends a town
  its watchmen wake in vain
What value has a life of haste,
  of endless, anxious toil?
God has for those who keep
          His law
 a garland none can spoil:
    Among God's gifts, a
        happy home -
   a blessing rich indeed,
a joyful, loving partnership,
a strength to those in need.
      That home, that house, as
             years go by
    must weather storm and strain;
      unless the Lord has built
              the house
        it must be built again.
