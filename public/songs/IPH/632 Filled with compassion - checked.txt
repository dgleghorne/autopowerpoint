         IPH 632
Filled With Compassion
Filled with compassion for
        all creation,
 Jesus came into a world
       that was lost.
There was but one way that
     He could save us,
   only through suffering
     death on a cross.
God, You are waiting, Your
     heart is breaking
for all the people who live
         on the earth.
Stir us to action, filled with
         Your passion
for all the people who live
         on the earth.
Great is Your passion for all
         the people
 living and dying without
       knowing You.
Having no Saviour, they’re
       lost forever,
if we don’t speak out and
    lead them to You.
God, You are waiting, Your
     heart is breaking
for all the people who live
         on the earth.
Stir us to action, filled with
         Your passion
for all the people who live
         on the earth.
From every nation we shall
       be gathered,
millions redeemed shall be
       Jesus’ reward.
Then He will turn and say to
         His Father:
  “Truly my suffering was
        worth it all.”
God, You are waiting, Your
     heart is breaking
for all the people who live
         on the earth.
     Stir us to action, filled with
              Your passion
     for all the people who live
              on the earth.
