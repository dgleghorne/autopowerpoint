         IPH 594
Help Us To Help Each Other
Help us to help each other, Lord,
   each otherâ€™s load to bear;
that all may live in true accord,
  our joys and pains to share.
Help us to build each other up,
Your strength within us prove;
increase our faith, confirm our
              hope,
  and fill us with Your love.
Together make us free indeed -
  Your life within us show;
and into You, our living head,
   let us in all things grow.
      Drawn by the magnet of Your
                   love
      we find our hearts made new:
      nearer each other let us move,
         and nearer still to You.
