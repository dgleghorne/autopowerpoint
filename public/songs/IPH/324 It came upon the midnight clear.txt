         IPH 324
It Came Upon The Midnight
          Clear
 It came upon the midnight clear,
      that glorious song of old,
from angels bending near the earth
    to touch their harps of gold:
‘Through all the earth, goodwill and
               peace
 from heaven’s all-gracious King!’
  The world in solemn stillness lay
      to hear the angels sing.
With sorrow brought by sin and
              strife
  the world has suffered long
and, since the angels sang, have
             passed
 two thousand years of wrong:
 The nations, still at war, hear not
  the love-song which they bring:
O hush the noise and cease the strife,
       to hear the angels sing!
And those whose journey now is hard,
     whose hope is burning low,
  who tread the rocky path of life
    with painful steps and slow:
 O listen to the news of love
which makes the heavens ring!
 O rest beside the weary road
  and hear the angels sing!
And still the days are hastening on –
     by prophets seen of old –
  towards the fullness of the time
   when comes the age foretold:
Then earth and heaven renewed shall
                  see
   the Prince of Peace, their King;
  and all the world repeat the song
     which now the angels sing.
