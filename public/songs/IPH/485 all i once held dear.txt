       IPH 485
All I Once Held Dear
 All I once held dear
 Built my life upon,
All this world reveres,
  And wars to own,
 All I once thought gain
  I have counted loss;
Spent and worthless now,
   Compared to this.
     Knowing You, Jesus,
        Knowing You,
   There is no greater thing,
 You’re my all, You’re the best,
You’re my joy, my righteousness,
     And I love You, Lord.
Now my heart’s desire
Is to know You more,
 To be found in You
And known as Yours,
 To possess by faith
What I could not earn,
 All-surpassing gift
  Of righteousness.
     Knowing You, Jesus,
        Knowing You,
   There is no greater thing,
 You’re my all, You’re the best,
You’re my joy, my righteousness,
     And I love You, Lord.
Oh, to know the power
  Of Your risen life,
 And to know You in
   Your sufferings;
  To become like You
In Your death, my Lord,
   So with You to live
     And never die.
        Knowing You, Jesus,
           Knowing You,
      There is no greater thing,
    You’re my all, You’re the best,
   You’re my joy, my righteousness,
        And I love You, Lord.
