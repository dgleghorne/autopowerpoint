  IPH 427
When I Survey
When I survey the wondrous cross
on which the Prince of Glory died,
  my richest gain I count as loss,
and pour contempt on all my pride.
 Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast
 save in the cross of Christ my God;
the very things that charm me most –
    I sacrifice them to His blood.
See from His head, His hands, His feet,
 sorrow and love flow mingled down:
 when did such love and sorrow meet,
  or thorns compose so rich a crown?
Were the whole realm of nature mine,
 that were an offering far too small;
     love so amazing, so divine,
 demands my soul, my life, my all!
