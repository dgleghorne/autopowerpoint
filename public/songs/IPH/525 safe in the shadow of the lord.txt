      IPH 525
Safe In The Shadow
    Of The Lord
Safe in the shadow of the
            Lord
 beneath His hand and
           power,
       I trust in Him,
       I trust in Him,
my fortress and my tower.
  My hope is set on God
            alone
through Satan spreads his
            snare;
       I trust in Him,
       I trust in Him,
  to keep me in His care.
From fears and phantoms
       of the night,
from foes about my way,
       I trust in Him,
       I trust in Him,
  by darkness as by day.
His holy angels keep my
            feet
secure from every stone;
      I trust in Him,
      I trust in Him,
  and unafraid go on.
      Strong in the
  everlasting Name,
and in my Father's care,
      I trust in Him,
      I trust in Him,
who hears and answers
          prayer.
        Safe in the shadow
             of the Lord,
      possessed by love divine,
            I trust in Him,
            I trust in Him,
       and meet His love with
                 mine.
