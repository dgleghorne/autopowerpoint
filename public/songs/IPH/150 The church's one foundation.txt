The Church’s One Foundation
The Church’s one foundation
  is Jesus Christ her Lord;
   she is His new creation
   by water and the Word:
from heaven He came and sought her
        to be His holy bride;
  with His own blood He bought her
       and for her life He died.
Called out from every nation,
 yet one through all the earth;
   her charter of salvation –
one Lord, one faith, one birth:
one holy name she blesses,
 and shares one holy food;
as to one hope she presses
 with every grace endued.
 We see her long divided
    by heresy and sect;
yet she by God is guided –
  one people, one elect:
   her vigil she is keeping,
her cry goes up, “How long?”
and soon the night of weeping
  shall be the dawn of song.
   In toil and tribulation,
   and tumult of her war,
she waits the consummation
   of peace for evermore:
 till with the vision glorious
her longing eyes are blessed;
at last the Church victorious
 shall be the Church at rest!
  Yet she on earth has union
 with God the Three-in-one;
and mystic, sweet communion
with those whose rest is won:
       O happy ones and holy!
    Lord, grant to us Your grace,
   with them the meek and lowly,
     in heaven to see Your face.
