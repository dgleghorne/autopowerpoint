He Gave Me Eyes
He gave me eyes so I could see
  the wonders of the world.
Without my eyes I could not see
   the other boys and girls.
He gave me ears so I could hear
   the wind and rain and sea.
 I’ve got to tell it to the world,
          He made me.
He gave me lips so I could speak
  and say what’s in my mind.
Without my lips I could not speak
     a single word or line.
He made my mind so I could think,
  and choose what I should be.
  I’ve got to tell it to the world,
           He made me.
He gave me hands so I could touch,
    and hold a thousand things.
I need my hands to help me write,
    to help me fetch and bring.
These feet He made so I could run,
     He meant me to be free.
  I’ve got to tell it to the world,
           He made me.
