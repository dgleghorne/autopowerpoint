           IPH 113
Come, Sing Praises To The Lord
Come, sing praises to the Lord above,
 Rock of our salvation, God of love;
with delight into His presence move,
   for the Lord our God is King!
    He’s the King above the
        mountains high,
the sea is His, the land and sky;
mighty continents and islands lie
 within the hollow of His hand.
 Come to worship Him and bow the
                knee,
 for the shepherd of the flock is He;
humble creatures in His hand are we –
  sing the praise of God the King!
    He’s the King above the
        mountains high,
the sea is His, the land and sky;
mighty continents and islands lie
 within the hollow of His hand.
   Hear the story of His people now,
 you with stubborn hearts who will not
                 bow;
learn what happened long ago and how
    God can show you He is King!
    He’s the King above the
        mountains high,
the sea is His, the land and sky;
mighty continents and islands lie
 within the hollow of His hand.
Forty years He kept the prize away,
    made them wander till they
          walked His way,
   exiled all of them until the day
 they should honour Him as King.
        He’s the King above the
            mountains high,
    the sea is His, the land and sky;
    mighty continents and islands lie
     within the hollow of His hand.
