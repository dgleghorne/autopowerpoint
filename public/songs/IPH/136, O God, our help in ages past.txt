         IPH 136
O God, Our Help In Ages Past
  O God, our help in ages past,
   our hope for years to come,
our shelter from the stormy blast,
      and our eternal home:
Beneath the shadow of Your
            throne
 Your people lived secure;
sufficient is Your arm alone,
  and our defence is sure.
Before the hills in order stood,
 or earth from darkness came,
from everlasting You are God,
   to endless years the same.
A thousand ages in Your sight
   are like an evening gone;
short as the watch that ends the
             night,
     before the rising sun.
Time, like an ever-rolling stream,
      will bear us all away;
  we pass forgotten, as a dream
   dies with the dawning day.
      O God, our help in ages past,
       our hope for years to come:
      be our defence while life shall
                   last,
          and our eternal home!
