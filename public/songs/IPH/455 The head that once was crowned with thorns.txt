The Head That Once Was Crowned
          With Thorns
The head that once was crowned
          with thorns
  is crowned with glory now;
     a royal diadem adorns
   the mighty Victor’s brow.
The highest place that heaven
             affords
    is His, is His by right;
the King of kings and Lord of
              lords
  and heaven’s eternal light.
The joy of all who dwell above,
      the joy of all below;
 to whom He demonstrates His
              love
 and grants His name to know.
  To them the cross with all its
              shame,
   with all its grace is given;
their name, an everlasting name,
  their joy, the joy of heaven.
   They suffer with their Lord
              below,
   they reign with Him above;
their profit and their joy to know
     the mystery of His love.
       The cross He bore is life and
                   health,
     though shame and death to Him;
      His people’s hope, His people’s
                   wealth,
          their everlasting theme.
