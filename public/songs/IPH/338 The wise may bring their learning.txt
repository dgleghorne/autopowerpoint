        IPH 338
The wise may bring their
       learning
   The wise may bring their
           learning,
the rich may bring their wealth,
  and some their strength and
            health:
   we too would bring our
           treasures
     to offer to the King;
we have no wealth or learning,
what gifts then shall we bring?
We’ll bring the many duties
 we have to do each day;
we’ll try our best to please
            Him,
at home, at school, at play:
and better are these treasures
       to offer to the King
than richest gifts without them;
  yet these we all may bring.
 We’ll bring Him hearts that
            love Him,
we’ll bring Him thankful praise,
  and lives for ever striving
       to follow His ways:
         and these shall be the
               treasures
          we offer to the King,
      and these are the gifts that
                  ever
     our grateful hearts may bring.
