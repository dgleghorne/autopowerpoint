         IPH 492
Before The Throne of God
Before the throne of God
          above
I have a strong, a perfect
           plea:
a great High Priest, whose
      name is Love,
who ever lives and pleads for me.
My name is written on His hands,
 my name is hidden in His heart;
 I know that while in heaven He
              stands
no power can force me to
        depart,
no power can force me to
        depart.
   When Satan tempts me to
            despair
 and tells me of the guilt within,
upward I look, and see Him there
 who made an end of all my sin.
Because the sinless Saviour died,
 my sinful soul is counted free;
  for God, the just, is satisfied
to look on Him and pardon
            me,
to look on Him and pardon
            me.
  Behold Him there! the risen
             Lamb,
      my perfect, sinless,
        Righteousness,
the great unchangeable I AM,
the King of glory and of grace!
One with my Lord I cannot die:
  my soul is purchased by His
               blood,
my life is safe with Christ on high,
         with Christ, my Saviour
             and my God,
         with Christ, my Saviour
             and my God.
