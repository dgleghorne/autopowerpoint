  IPH 487
And Can It Be
   And can it be that I should gain
  an interest in the Saviour’s blood?
Died He for me, who caused His pain?
 For me, who Him to death pursued?
     Amazing love! how can it be
that You, my God, should die for me?
     Amazing love! How can it be
that You, my God, should die for me?
 What mystery here! The Immortal
                 dies!
Who can explore His strange design?
    In vain the highest angel tries
 to sound the depths of love divine!
What mercy this! let earth adore;
let angels minds inquire no more.
What mercy this! let earth adore;
let angels minds inquire no more.
He left His Father’s throne above -
  so free, so infinite His grace –
 humbled Himself in all His love
and bled for Adam’s helpless race.
What mercy this, immense and free,
 for, O my God, it found out me!
What mercy this, immense and free,
 for, O my God, it found out me!
     Long my imprisoned spirit lay
  fast bound in sin and nature’s night:
  then shone Your glorious gospel ray;
I woke! the dungeon flamed with light!
My chains fell off; my heart was new,
I rose, went forth and followed You!
My chains fell off; my heart was new,
I rose, went forth and followed You!
  No condemnation now I dread!
  Jesus, and all in Him, is mine!
  Alive in Him, my living head,
and clothed in righteousness divine,
   bold I approach the eternal throne
     and claim the crown, through
            Christ my own.
   bold I approach the eternal throne
     and claim the crown, through
            Christ my own.
