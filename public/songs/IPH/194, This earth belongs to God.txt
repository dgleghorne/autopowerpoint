         IPH 194
This Earth Belongs To God
      This earth belongs to God,
the world, its wealth and all its people;
     He formed the waters wide
  and fashioned every sea and shore.
 Men: Who may go up the hill of the
Lord and stand in the place of holiness?

 Women: Only the one whose heart is
 pure, whose hands and lips are clean.
Lift high your heads, you gates,
 rise up, you everlasting doors,
 as here now the King of glory
    enters into full command.
 Men: Who is the King, this King of
glory, where is the throne He comes to
                 claim?

Women: Christ is the King, the Lord of
   glory, fresh from His victory.
   Lift high your heads, you gates,
and fling wide open the ancient doors,
  for here comes the King of glory
        taking universal power.
 Men: Who is the King, this King of
glory, what is the power by which He
                reigns?

Women: Christ is the King, His cross
 His glory, and by love He rules.
          All glory be to God
   the Father, Son and Holy Spirit;
         from ages past it was,
    is now, and ever more shall be.
