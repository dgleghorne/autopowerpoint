   IPH 86
God Is So Good
 God is so good,
 God is so good,
 God is so good,
He’s so good to me.
 He took my sin,
 He took my sin,
 He took my sin,
He’s so good to me.
  Now I am free,
  now I am free,
  now I am free,
He’s so good to me.
             God is so good,
             He took my sin,
              now I am free,
            He’s so good to me.
