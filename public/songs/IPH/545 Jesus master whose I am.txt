Jesus, Master, Whose I Am
   Jesus Master, whose I am,
 purchased Yours alone to be,
by Your blood, O perfect Lamb,
    shed so willingly for me:
Let my heart be all Your own,
  let me live to You alone.
   Jesus, Master, I am Yours,
keep me faithful, keep me near,
shine on all my days and hours,
all my homeward way to cheer.
Jesus! At Your feet I fall;
be my Lord, my all-in-all!
Jesus, Master, whom I serve,
 though so feebly and so ill,
  strengthen hand and heart
          and nerve.
  all Your bidding to fulfil:
   Open now my eyes to see
all the work You have for me.
 Jesus, Master, will You use
one who owes You more than
             all?
  As You will! I would not
           choose;
 only let me hear Your call.
         Jesus, let me always be
     in Your service, glad and free.
