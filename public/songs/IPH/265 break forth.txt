         IPH 265
Break Forth, O Living Light
Break forth, O living light of God,
   upon the world’s dark hour!
Show us the way the Master trod;
     reveal his saving power.
Remove the veil of ancient words
   their message long obscure;
 restore to us Your truth, O God,
   and make its meaning sure.
O let Your word be light anew
    to every nation’s life;
unite us in Your will, O Lord,
   and end all sinful strife.
     O may one Lord, one Faith, one
                  Word,
          one Spirit lead us still;
     and one great Church go forth in
                  might
       to work God’s perfect will.
