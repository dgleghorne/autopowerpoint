          IPH 493
Blessed are the pure in heart
 Blessed are the pure in heart,
  for they shall see their God;
the secret of the Lord is theirs,
  their soul is Christâ€™s abode.
The Lord, who left the heavens
  our life and peace to bring,
 to dwell in lowliness with us,
   our pattern and our King;
   Still too the lowly soul
   Himself He will impart,
and for His dwelling and His
             throne
 chooses the pure in heart.
Lord, we Your presence seek-
   we ask this blessing too;
give us a pure and lowly heart,
      a temple fit for you.
