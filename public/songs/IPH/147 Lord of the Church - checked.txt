     IPH 147
Lord of the Church
Lord of the Church, we pray for
         our renewing:
 Christ over all, our undivided
              aim.
 Fire of the Spirit, burn for our
             enduing,
wind of the Spirit, fan the living
              flame!
We turn to Christ amid our fear
           and failing,
the will that lacks the courage
            to be free,
 the weary labours, all but
          unavailing,
to bring us nearer to what a
      Church should be.
Lord of the Church, we seek
     a Father’s blessing,
a true repentance and a faith
           restored,
 a swift obedience and a new
            possessing,
filled with the Holy Spirit of the
               Lord!
We turn to Christ from all our
      restless striving,
 unnumbered voices with a
        single prayer:
the living water for our souls’
            reviving,
in Christ to live, and love and
         serve and care.
Lord of our Church, we long for
           our uniting,
  true to one calling, by one
          vision stirred;
one cross proclaiming and one
         creed reciting,
 one in the truth of Jesus and
           His word.
 So lead us on; till toil and
       trouble ended,
one Church triumphant one
    new song shall sing,
       to praise His glory, risen and
                 ascended,
       Christ over all, the everlasting
                    King!
