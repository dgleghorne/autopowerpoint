  IPH 261
Almighty God
 Almighty God, Your word is cast
    like seed into the ground:
now let the dew of heaven descend,
   and righteous fruits abound.
Let not the foe of Christ and man
     this holy seed remove:
 but give it root in every heart,
  to bring forth fruits of love.
Let not the worldâ€™s deceitful cares
      the rising plant destroy;
  but let it yield a hundredfold
    the fruits of peace and joy.
  Oft as the precious seed is sown,
   Your quickening grace bestow;
that all whose souls the truth receive
     its saving power may know.
