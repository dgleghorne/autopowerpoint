     IPH 98
The King Of Love
The King of Love my shepherd is,
 whose goodness fails me never;
    I nothing lack if I am His
     and He is mine for ever.
Where streams of living water flow
  a ransomed soul, He leads me;
and where the fertile pastures grow,
 with food from heaven feeds me.
Perverse and foolish I have strayed,
  but in His love He sought me;
 and on His shoulder gently laid,
 and home rejoicing, brought me.
 In deathâ€™s dark vale I fear no ill,
 with You, dear Lord, beside me;
Your rod and staff my comfort still,
  Your cross before to guide me.
You spread a banquet in my sight
  of love beyond all knowing;
 and O the gladness and delight
from Your pure chalice flowing!
 And so through all the length of days
   Your goodness fails me never:
Good Shepherd, may I sing Your praise
     within Your house for ever!
