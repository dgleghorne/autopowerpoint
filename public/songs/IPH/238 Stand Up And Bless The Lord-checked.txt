Stand Up And Bless
     The Lord
Stand up and bless the Lord,
  you people of His choice;
   stand up and praise the
       Lord your God
with heart and soul and voice.
Though high above all praise,
  above all blessing high,
     who would not fear
       His holy name,
   give thanks and glory?
     O for the living flame
  from His own altar brought
       to touch our lips,
       our minds inspire,
and wing to heaven our thought!
God is our strength and song,
    and His salvation ours;
   then be His love in Christ
           proclaimed
with all our ransomed powers.
   Stand up and bless the Lord,
     the Lord your God adore;
        stand up and praise
         His glorious name
      both now and evermore.
