      IPH 567
Rise Up, O Church Of
        God!
 Rise up, O Church of God!
Have done with lesser things;
give heart and soul and mind
         and strength
  to serve the King of kings.
Rise up, O Church of God!
 His kingdom tarries long;
    bring in the day of
       righteousness
and end the night of wrong.
 Rise up, O Church of God!
   Must He for ever wait?
His strength shall make your
         spirit strong
   in serving to be great.
      Lift high the cross of Christ!
      Tread where His feet have
                   trod;
     as servants of the Son of Man
       rise up, O Church of God.
