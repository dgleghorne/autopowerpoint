    IPH 241
The Lord Is King!
The Lord is King! lift up your
            voice,
O earth, and all you heavens,
           rejoice!
From world to world the joy shall
             ring,
 ‘The Lord omnipotent is King!’
  The Lord is King! who then
           shall dare
resist His will, distrust His care
or murmur at His wise decrees,
 or doubt His royal promises?
  The Lord is King! child of the
              dust,
the Judge of all the earth is just;
holy and true are all His ways;
 let every creature speak His
            praise!
Come, make your wants, your
       burdens known;
Christ will present them at the
             throne;
and He is at the Father’s side,
the Man of love, the Crucified.
   One Lord, one empire, all
            secures;
He reigns, and life and death are
             Yours;
         through earth and heaven one
                song shall ring,
         ‘The Lord omnipotent is King!’
