To Be In Your Presence
 To be in Your presence,
    to sit at Your feet,
where Your love surrounds
            me,
and makes me complete:
This is my desire, O Lord,
     this is my desire;
this is my desire, O Lord,
     this is my desire.
 To rest in Your presence,
     not rushing away,
to cherish each moment –
     here I would stay:
      This is my desire, O Lord,
           this is my desire;
      this is my desire, O Lord,
           this is my desire.
