Spirit of God
 Spirit of God, unseen as the
             wind,
      gentle as the dove;
teach us the truth and help us
            believe,
  show us the Saviour’s love.
   You spoke to us long, long
                ago,
   gave us the written word;
we read it still, needing its truth,
through it God’s voice is heard.
 Spirit of God, unseen as the
             wind,
      gentle as the dove;
teach us the truth and help us
            believe,
  show us the Saviour’s love.
Without Your help we fail Lord,
    we cannot live his way;
we need Your Power, we need
         Your strength,
  following Christ each day.
 Spirit of God, unseen as the
             wind,
      gentle as the dove;
teach us the truth and help us
            believe,
  show us the Saviour’s love.
