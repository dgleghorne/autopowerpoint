     IPH 634
Go Forth And Tell!
Go forth and tell! O Church of
         God, awake!
 God’s saving news to all the
         nations take:
proclaim Christ Jesus, Saviour,
        Lord, and King,
 that all the world His worthy
        praise may sing.
Go forth and tell! God’s love
         embraces all;
He will in grace respond to all
           who call:
how shall they call if they have
          never heard
 the gracious invitation of His
            word?
Go forth and tell! where still the
         darkness lies
 in wealth or want, the sinner
          surely dies:
give us, O Lord, concern of heart
            and mind,
a love like Yours which cares for
           humankind.
Go forth and tell! the doors are
          open wide:
share God’s good gifts – let no
        one be denied;
live out your life as Christ your
       Lord shall choose,
 your ransomed powers for His
         sole glory use.
Go forth and tell! O Church of
          God, arise!
Go in the strength which Christ
      your Lord supplies;
    go till all nations His great name
                    adore
   and serve Him, Lord and King for
                 evermore.
