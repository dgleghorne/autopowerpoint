      IPH 274
Tell me the old old story
Tell me the old, old story of unseen
          things above,
 Of Jesus and His glory, of Jesus
           and His love.
 Tell me the story simply, as to a
            little child,
 For I am weak and weary, and
       helpless and defiled.
              Chorus
Tell me the old, old story, tell me
        the old, old story,
Tell me the old, old story, of Jesus
          and His love.
  Tell me the story slowly, that I
          may take it in,
That wonderful redemption, God’s
          remedy for sin.
Tell me the story often, for I forget
              so soon;
  The early dew of morning has
      passed away at noon.
              Chorus
Tell me the old, old story, tell me
        the old, old story,
Tell me the old, old story, of Jesus
          and His love.
   Tell me the story softly, with
     earnest tones and grave;
 Remember I’m the sinner whom
        Jesus came to save.
  Tell me the story always, if you
         would really be,
In any time of trouble, a comforter
               to me.
              Chorus
Tell me the old, old story, tell me
        the old, old story,
Tell me the old, old story, of Jesus
          and His love.
 Tell me the same old story when
      you have cause to fear
 That this world’s empty glory is
       costing me too dear.
Yes, and when that world’s glory is
       dawning on my soul,
Tell me the old, old story: “Christ
     Jesus makes thee whole.”
              Chorus
Tell me the old, old story, tell me
        the old, old story,
Tell me the old, old story, of Jesus
          and His love.
