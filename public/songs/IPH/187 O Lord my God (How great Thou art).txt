     IPH 187
How Great Thou Art
O Lord my God, when I in
   awesome wonder
consider all the works Thy
   hand hath made,
 I see the stars, I hear the
      mighty thunder,
Thy power throughout the
    universe displayed;
 Then sings my soul, my
 Saviour God, to Thee:
How great Thou art! How
    great Thou art!
 Then sings my soul, my
 Saviour God, to Thee:
How great Thou art! How
    great Thou art!
 When through the woods
and forest glades I wander
  and hear the birds sing
   sweetly in the trees;
 when I look down from lofty
    mountain grandeur,
and hear the brook, and feel
     the gentle breeze;
 Then sings my soul, my
 Saviour God, to Thee:
How great Thou art! How
    great Thou art!
 Then sings my soul, my
 Saviour God, to Thee:
How great Thou art! How
    great Thou art!
 And when I think that God,
     His son not sparing,
sent Him to die – I scarce can
           take it in,
that on the cross my burden
       gladly bearing,
  He bled and died to take
        away my sin:
 Then sings my soul, my
 Saviour God, to Thee:
How great Thou art! How
    great Thou art!
 Then sings my soul, my
 Saviour God, to Thee:
How great Thou art! How
    great Thou art!
When Christ shall come with
  shout of acclamation
and take me home – what
   joy shall fill my heart!
 Then shall I bow in humble
         adoration
and there proclaim, my God,
    how great Thou art!
 Then sings my soul, my
 Saviour God, to Thee:
How great Thou art! How
    great Thou art!
       Then sings my soul, my
       Saviour God, to Thee:
      How great Thou art! How
          great Thou art!
