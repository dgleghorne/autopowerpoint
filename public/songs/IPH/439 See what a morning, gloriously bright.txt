     IPH 439
See What A Morning
   See what a morning,
      gloriously bright
with the dawning of hope in
         Jerusalem;
folded the grave clothes, tomb-
         filled with light
as the angels announce Christ
              is risen!
  See God’s salvation plan,
wrought in love, borne in pain,
      paid in sacrifice,
 fulfilled in Christ the man,
for He lives; Christ is risen
         from the dead.
See Mary weeping, ‘Where is
           He laid?’
 as in sorrow she turns from
       the empty tomb;
hears a voice speaking, calling
           her name;
it’s the Master, the Lord raised
          to life again!
The voice that spans the years,
  speaking life, stirring hope,
     bringing peace to us,
will sound till He appears,
for He lives; Christ is risen
       from the dead.
 One with the Father, Ancient
           of Days,
through the Spirit who clothes
     faith with certainty,
honour and blessing, glory
        and praise,
 to the King crowned with
   power and authority!
And we are raised with Him,
death is dead, love has won,
   Christ has conquered;
   and we shall reign with Him,
    for He lives; Christ is risen
          from the dead.
