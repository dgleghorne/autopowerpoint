       IPH 367
We cannot measure how
      You heal
 We cannot measure
   how You heal
  or answer every
  sufferer's prayer,
yet we believe Your
   grace responds
where faith and doubt
    unite to care.
Your hands, though bloodied
        on the cross,
    survive to hold and
       heal and warn,
    to carry all through
        death to life
    and cradle children
        yet unborn.
   The pain that will
     not go away,
  the guilt that clings
from things long past,
  the fear of what the
      future holds,
are present as if meant
         to last.
  But present too is love
       which tends
 the hurt we never hoped
          to find,
the private agonies inside,
    the memories that
     haunt the mind.
So some have come who
     need Your help
 and some have come to
      make amends,
 as hands which shaped
   and saved the world
 are present in the touch
        of friends.
 Lord, let Your Spirit
     meet us here
  to mend the body,
    mind and soul,
 to disentangle peace
       from pain
and make Your broken
    people whole.
