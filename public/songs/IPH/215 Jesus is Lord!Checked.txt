Jesus is Lord!
  Jesus is Lord! Creation's
     voice proclaims it,
for by His power each tree
 and flower was planned
        and made.
Jesus is Lord! The universe
        declares it –
  sun, moon and stars in
heaven cry: ‘Jesus is Lord!’
Jesus is Lord! Jesus is Lord!
 Praise Him with alleluias,
     for Jesus is Lord!
 Jesus is Lord! Yet from His
       throne eternal
in flesh He came to die in
            pain
     on Calvary’s tree.
Jesus is Lord! From Him all
    life proceeding –
yet gave His life a ransom
   thus setting us free.
Jesus is Lord! Jesus is Lord!
 Praise Him with alleluias,
     for Jesus is Lord!
  Jesus is Lord! O’er sin the
     mighty conqueror;
from death He rose, and all
His foes shall own His name.
 Jesus is Lord! God sent His
           Holy Spirit
to show by works of power
     that Jesus is Lord!
    Jesus is Lord! Jesus is Lord!
     Praise Him with alleluias,
         for Jesus is Lord!
