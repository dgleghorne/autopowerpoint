    IPH 309
Away In A Manger
         Away in a manger,
           no crib for a bed,
the little Lord Jesus laid down His
             sweet head;
the stars in the bright sky looked
        down where He lay,
the little Lord Jesus asleep on the
                hay.
The cattle are lowing, the Baby
            awakes,
but little Lord Jesus no crying
           He makes.
 I love You, Lord Jesus!
Look down from the sky,
and stay by my side until
     morning is nigh.
Be near me, Lord Jesus;
   I ask You to stay
 close by me for ever,
 and love me, I pray.
Bless all the dear children in Your
            tender care,
and fit us for heaven, to live with
             You there.
