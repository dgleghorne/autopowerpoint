The Journey of Life May Be
    Easy, May Be Hard
The journey of life may be easy,
           may be hard,
 there’ll be dangers on the way;
  with Christ at my side I’ll do
          battle as I ride
‘gainst the foe that would lead me
              astray.
Will you ride, ride, ride with the
         King of kings,
will you follow my leader true;
will you shout hosanna to the
      lowly Son of God,
 who died for me and you?
My burden is light and a song is
          in my heart,
   as I travel on life’s way;
for Christ is my Lord and He’s
     given me His word,
  that by my side He’ll stay.
Will you ride, ride, ride with the
         King of kings,
will you follow my leader true;
will you shout hosanna to the
      lowly Son of God,
 who died for me and you?
When doubts arise and when
   tears are in my eyes,
 when all seems lost to me,
with Christ as my guide I can
   smile whate’er betide,
 for He my strength will be.
Will you ride, ride, ride with the
         King of kings,
will you follow my leader true;
will you shout hosanna to the
      lowly Son of God,
 who died for me and you?
I’ll follow my leader wherever
            He may go,
      for Jesus is my friend;
  He’ll lead me on to the place
       where He has gone,
when I come to my journey’s end.
Will you ride, ride, ride with the
         King of kings,
will you follow my leader true;
will you shout hosanna to the
      lowly son of God,
 who died for me and you?
