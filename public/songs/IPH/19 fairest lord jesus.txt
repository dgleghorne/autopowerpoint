     IPH 19
Fairest Lord Jesus
       Fairest Lord Jesus,
      Lord of all creation,
Jesus, of God and man the Son;
     You will I cherish,
     You will I honour,
You are my soul’s delight and
          crown.
        Fair are the rivers,
      meadows and forests
clothed in the fresh green robes of
              spring;
      Jesus is fairer,
      Jesus is purer,
He makes the saddest heart to
           sing.
       Fair is the sunrise,
    starlight and moonlight
spreading their glory across the
               sky;
       Jesus shines brighter,
        Jesus shines clearer,
than all the heavenly host on high.
      All fairest beauty,
    heavenly and earthly,
Jesus, my Lord, in You I see;
       none can be nearer,
         fairer or dearer
 than You, my saviour, are to me.
