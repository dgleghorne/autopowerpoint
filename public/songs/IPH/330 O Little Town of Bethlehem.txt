          IPH 330
O Little Town Of Bethlehem
 O little town of Bethlehem,
   how still we see you lie!
Above your deep and dreamless
             sleep
    the silent stars go by.
Yet, in your dark streets shining
      the everlasting Light;
 the hopes and fears of all the
              years
    are met in you to-night.
    O morning stars, together
     proclaim the holy birth
and praises sing to God the King,
    and peace to all on earth.
  For Christ is born of Mary;
    and, gathered all above,
while mortals sleep, the angels
              keep
their watch of wondering love.
   How silently, how silently
   the wondrous gift is given!
So God imparts to human hearts
  the blessings of His heaven.
No ear may hear His coming;
   but in this world of sin,
where meek souls will receive
           Him, still
  the dear Christ enters in.
O holy Child of Bethlehem,
   descend to us, we pray;
cast out our sin, and enter in,
     be born in us today.
       We hear the Christmas angels
        the great glad tidings tell:
       O come to us, abide with us,
          our Lord Emmanuel.
