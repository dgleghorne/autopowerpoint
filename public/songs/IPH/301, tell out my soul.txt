Tell out, my soul, the greatness of
             the Lord!
 Unnumbered blessings, give my
            spirit voice;
tender to me the promise of His
             word;
  in God my Saviour shall my
          heart rejoice.
Tell out, my soul, the greatness
          of His name:
  make known His might, the
   deeds His arm has done;
His mercy sure, from age to age
           the same;
  His holy name, the Lord, the
          Mighty One.
Tell out, my soul, the greatness
          of His might!
Powers and dominions lay their
            glory by.
 Proud hearts and stubborn wills
        are put to flight,
the hungry fed, the humble lifted
              high.
Tell out, my soul, the glories of
           His word!
 Firm is His promise, and His
          mercy sure.
Tell out, my soul, the greatness
           of the Lord
 to childrenâ€™s children and for
           evermore!
