        IPH 107
Lead Us Heavenly Father
Lead us, Heavenly Father, lead us
   over life’s tempestuous sea;
guard and guide us, keep and feed
                 us,
help from you alone have we,
yet possessing every blessing
    in our God eternally.
Saviour, breathe forgiveness on us,
  all our sins You surely know;
You did tread this earth before us,
  You did feel all earthly woe;
lone and dreary, faint and weary,
 through the desert You did go.
   Spirit of our God descending,
 fill our hearts with heavenly joy,
love with every passion blending,
        pleasure that can never cloy:
      thus provided, pardoned, guided,
       nothing can our peace destroy.
