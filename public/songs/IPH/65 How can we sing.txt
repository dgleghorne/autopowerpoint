How Can We Sing
How can we sing with joy to God,
   how can we pray to Him,
 when we are far away from God
     in selfishness and sin?
 How can we claim to do God’s will
    when we have turned away
from things of God to things of earth,
       and willed to disobey?
 How can we praise the love of God
 which all His works make known,
when all our works turn from His love
       to choices of our own?
God knows the sinful things we do,
     the godless life we live,
  yet in His love He calls to us,
        so ready to forgive.
  So we will turn again to God –
    His ways will be our ways,
His will our will, His love our love,
    and He Himself our praise!
