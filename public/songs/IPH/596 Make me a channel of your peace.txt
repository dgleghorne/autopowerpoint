        IPH 596
Make Me A Channel Of Your
         Peace
Make me a channel of Your
          peace.
Where there is hatred let me
     bring Your love.
 Where there is injury, Your
       pardon, Lord,
and where there’s doubt, true
        faith in You.
 Oh Master, grant that I may
        never seek
so much to be consoled as to
          console,
    to be understood as to
         understand,
to be loved, as to love with all
           my soul.
 Make me a channel of Your
           peace.
Where there’s despair in life let
       me bring hope.
 Where there is darkness, only
             light,
and where there’s sadness, ever
               joy
 Oh Master, grant that I may
        never seek
so much to be consoled as to
          console,
    to be understood as to
         understand,
to be loved, as to love with all
           my soul.
 Make me a channel of Your
             peace.
It is in pardoning that we are
            pardoned
 in giving of ourselves that we
             receive,
and in dying that we are born to
           eternal life
 Oh Master, grant that I may
        never seek
so much to be consoled as to
          console,
           to be understood as to
                understand,
       to be loved, as to love with all
                  my soul.
