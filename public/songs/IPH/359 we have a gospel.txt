We Have A Gospel To Proclaim
 We have a gospel to proclaim,
good news for all throughout the
             earth;
the gospel of a Saviour’s name:
we sing His glory, tell His worth.
   Tell of His birth at Bethlehem,
     not in a royal house or hall
    but in a stable dark and dim,
the Word made flesh, a light for all.
   Tell of His death at Calvary,
 hated by those He came to save,
 in lonely suffering on the cross;
for all He loved His life He gave.
 Tell of that glorious Easter morn:
 empty the tomb, for He was free.
He broke the power of death and hell
  that we might share His victory.
Tell of His reign at God’s right hand,
       by all creation glorified.
 He sends His Spirit on His church
to live for Him, the Lamb who died.
Now we rejoice to name Him King:
     Jesus is Lord of all earth.
This gospel-message we proclaim:
 we sing His glory, tell His worth.
