 IPH 509
Love Divine
  Love divine, all loves excelling,
Joy of heaven, to earth come down:
 Fix in us Your humble dwelling,
 All Your faithful mercies crown.
  Jesus, You are all compassion,
boundless love that makes us whole;
   visit us with Your salvation,
    enter every trembling soul.
  Come, almighty to deliver,
 Let us all Your grace receive;
  Suddenly return, and never,
Nevermore Your temples leave:
 You we would be always blessing,
   serve You as Your hosts above,
pray and praise You without ceasing,
     glory in Your perfect love.
Finish then Your new creation,
   pure and sinless let us be;
let us see Your great salvation
       perfect in eternity:
    changed from glory into glory
   till in heaven we take our place,
 till we lay our crowns before You,
   lost in wonder, love and praise.
