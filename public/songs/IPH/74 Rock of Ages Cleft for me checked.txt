  IPH 74
Rock Of Ages
    Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
   hide me now, my refuge be;
 let the water and the blood from
Your wounded side which flowed,
     be for sin the double cure,
cleanse me from its guilt and power.
  Not the labours of my hands
can fulfill Your law’s demands;
could my zeal no respite know,
 could my tears for ever flow,
all for sin could not atone: You
   must save and You alone.
 Nothing in my hand I bring,
simply to Your Cross I cling;
naked, come to You for dress,
helpless, look to You for grace;
  stained by sin, to You I cry:
 ‘Wash me, Saviour, or I die!’
While I draw this fleeting breath,
when my eyelids close in death,
 when I soar through realms
           unknown,
Bow before the judgment throne:
  hide me then, my refuge be,
  Rock of Ages, cleft for me.
