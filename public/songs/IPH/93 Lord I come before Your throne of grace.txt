          IPH 93
Lord, I Come Before Your
    Throne Of Grace
     Lord, I come before
    Your throne of grace;
I find rest in Your presence,
     and fullness of joy.
      In worship and wonder
        I behold Your face,
singing what a faithful God have I.
What a faithful God have I,
   what a faithful God.
What a faithful God have I,
  faithful in every way.
     Lord of mercy, You
     have heard me cry;
through the storm You’re the
beacon, my song in the night.
   In the shelter of Your wings,
       hear my heart’s reply,
singing what a faithful God have I.
What a faithful God have I,
   what a faithful God.
What a faithful God have I,
  faithful in every way.
Lord all sovereign, granting
     peace from heaven,
 let me comfort those who
suffer with the comfort You
         have given.
 I will tell of Your great love for as
      long for as long as I live,
singing what a faithful God have I.
      What a faithful God have I,
         what a faithful God.
      What a faithful God have I,
        faithful in every way.
