       IPH 191
Such Love, Pure As The
    Whitest Snow
Such love, pure as the whitest snow;
  such love weeps for the shame I
               know;
 such love, paying the debt I owe;
        O Jesus, such love.
Such love, stilling my restlessness;
 such love, filling my emptiness;
 such love, showing me holiness;
       O Jesus, such love.
  Such love springs from eternity;
such love, streaming through history;
  such love, fountain of life to me;
         O Jesus, such love.
