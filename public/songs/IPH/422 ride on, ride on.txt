    IPH 422
Ride on, Ride on
   Ride on, ride on in majesty,
as all the crowds ‘Hosanna!’ cry;
through waving branches slowly
               ride,
    O Saviour, to be crucified.
   Ride on, ride on in majesty,
  in lowly pomp ride on to die;
O Christ, Your triumph now begin
     with captured death, and
          conquered sin!
 Ride on, ride on in majesty —
   the angel armies of the sky
     look down with sad and
         wondering eyes
to see the approaching sacrifice.
 Ride on, ride on in majesty
the last and fiercest foe defy;
 the Father on His sapphire
            throne
awaits His own anointed Son.
      Ride on, ride on in majesty,
     in lowly pomp ride on to die;
    bow Your meek head to mortal
                  pain,
    then take, O God, Your power
               and reign!
