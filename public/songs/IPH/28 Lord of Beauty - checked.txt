   IPH 28
Lord Of Beauty
   Lord of beauty, Yours the
           splendour
shown in earth and sky and sea,
  burning sun and moonlight
            tender,
  hill and river, flower and tree:
 lest we fail our praise to render
touch our eyes that we may see.
Lord of wisdom, whom obeying
 mighty waters ebb and flow,
 while unhasting, undelaying,
  planets on their courses go:
in Your laws Yourself displaying,
  teach our minds Your truth to
             know.
  Lord of life, alone sustaining
    all below and all above,
Lord of love, by whose ordaining
 sun and stars sublimely move:
  in our earthly spirits reigning,
lift our hearts that we may love.
Lord of beauty, bid us own You,
Lord of truth, our footsteps guide,
 till as love our hearts enthrone
               You,
     and, with vision purified,
  Lord of all, when all have known
                You,
      You in all are glorified.
