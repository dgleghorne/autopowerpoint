       Purify my heart,
let me be as gold and precious

                Lord;
 I choose to be holy, set apart for

my Master, ready to do Your will.
      Purify my heart,
 cleanse me from within and
       make me holy;
       purify my heart,
cleanse me from my sin, deep
           within.
