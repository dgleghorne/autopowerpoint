O God Of Our Divided World
 O God of our divided world,
 light up Your way where our
           ways part.
Restore the Kinship of our birth,
  revive in us a single heart –
A heart that sees in Christ its goal
 and cares with Christ for every
                one,
  that seeks beyond all outward
               forms
 a fellowship in God’s own son.
   Where we have failed to
           understand
another’s heart, O Lord forgive.
Grant us the confidence to share
    the lights whereby our
        neighbours live.
     Then shall we know a richer
                 world
   where all divisions are disowned,
   where heart joins heart and hand
              joins hand,
    where each is loved and Christ
              enthroned.
