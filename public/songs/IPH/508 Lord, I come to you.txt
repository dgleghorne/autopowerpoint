       IPH 508
Lord I come to you
   Lord I come to You -
Let my heart be changed
        Renewed,
 Flowing from the grace,
    That I found in You.
  And Lord I’ve come to
           know,
 The weakness I see in me
  Will be stripped away,
by the power of Your love:
      Hold me close,
Let Your love surround me,
bring me near, draw me to
         Your side,
and as I wait, I’ll rise up like an
                eagle
 and I will soar with You, Your
       spirit leads me on,
  in the power of Your love.
     Lord unveil my eyes
let me see You face to face,
 the knowledge of Your love,
       as You live in me

    Lord renew my mind
As Your will unfolds in my life
     In living every day
 By the power of Your love
      Hold me close,
let your love surround me,
      bring me near
   draw me to your side
           and as I wait,
I’ll rise up like an eagle, and I
          will soar with you
your spirit leads me one, in he
        power of your love.
   and I will sore with you, your
         spirit leads me on
    in the power of your love.
