         IPH 512
May the mind of Christ my
        Saviour
May the mind of Christ my Saviour
   live in me from day to day,
by His love and power controlling
          all I do and say.
May the word of God enrich me
in my heart, from hour to hour,
 so that all may see I triumph
    only though His power.
  May the peace of God my
             Father
   in my life for ever reign,
that I may be calm to comfort
    those in grief and pain.
May the love of Jesus fill me
 as the waters fill the sea,
 Him exalting, self abasing,
       this is victory!
May His beauty rest upon me
as I seek to make Him known:
so that all may look to Jesus,
       seeing Him alone.
     May I run the race before me,
     strong and brave to face the
                   foe,
     looking all the while to Jesus
            as I onward go.
