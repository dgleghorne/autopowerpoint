Good Christians All Rejoice
 Good Christians all, rejoice
with heart and soul and voice!
 Listen now to what we say,
 Jesus Christ is born today;
 ox and ass before Him bow
and He is in the manger now!
    Christ is born today;
    Christ is born today!
 Good Christians all, rejoice
with heart and soul and voice!
Hear the news of endless bliss,
 Jesus Christ is born for this:
  He has opened heavenâ€™s door
and we are blessed for evermore!
    Christ was born for this;
    Christ was born for this!
  Good Christians all, rejoice
 with heart and soul and voice!
Now you need not fear the grave;
 Jesus Christ was born to save:
  come at His most gracious call
   to find salvation, one and all!
      Christ was born to save;
      Christ was born to save!
