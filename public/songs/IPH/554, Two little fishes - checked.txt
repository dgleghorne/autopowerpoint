Two Little Fishes
    Two little fishes,
 five loaves of bread,
five thousand people
  by Jesus were fed.
This is what happened
  when one little lad
  gladly gave Jesus
    all that he had.
        All that I have,
        All that I have,
I will give Jesus all that I have.
  One lonely widow,
   two coins small.
 Jesus was watching
when she gave her all,
       and Jesus said,
as His heart was made glad,
     that she had given
       all that she had.
                       All that I have,
                       All that I have,
      I will give Jesus all that I have.
