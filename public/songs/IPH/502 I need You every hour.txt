       IPH 502
I Need You Every Hour
 I need You every hour, most
        gracious Lord:
no tender voice like Yours can
        peace afford.
 I need You, O I need You;
   every hour I need You;
O bless me now, my Saviour!
       I come to You.
I need You every hour: Lord stay
             nearby;
   temptations lose their power
       when You are nigh.
 I need You, O I need You;
   every hour I need You;
O bless me now, my Saviour!
       I come to You.
I need You every hour, in joy or
             pain;
 come quickly and abide, or life
            is vain.
 I need You, O I need You;
   every hour I need You;
O bless me now, my Saviour!
       I come to You.
I need You every hour: teach
        me Your will,
and Your rich promises in me
            fulfil.
    I need You, O I need You;
      every hour I need You;
   O bless me now, my Saviour!
          I come to You.
