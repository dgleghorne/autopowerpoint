         IPH 272
Lord, Your word shall guide
            us
Lord, Your word shall guide us
  and with truth provide us:
    teach us to receive it
    and with joy believe it.
  When our foes are near us,
then Your word shall cheer us –
     word of consolation,
    message of salvation.
When the storms distress us
and dark clouds oppress us,
then Your word protects us
  and its light directs us.
Who can tell the pleasure,
who recount the treasure
 by Your word imparted
 to the simple-hearted?
Word of mercy, giving
courage to the living;
word of life, supplying
comfort to the dying.
               O that we discerning
             its most holy learning,
    Lord, may love and fear You –
             Evermore be near You!

Henry William Baker, 1821 – 1877      CCLI 128675
