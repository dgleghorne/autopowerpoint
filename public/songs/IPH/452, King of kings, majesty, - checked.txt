       IPH 452
King of Kings, Majesty
   King of kings, majesty,
 God of heaven living in me,
gentle Saviour, closest Friend,
 strong Deliverer, Beginning and
               End,
all within me falls at Your throne.
 Your majesty, I can but bow.
 I lay my all before You now.
In royal robes I don’t deserve
I live to serve Your majesty,
I live to serve Your majesty.
Earth and heaven worship You,
Love eternal, faithful and true,
   who bought the nations,
       ransomed souls,
brought this sinner near to Your
             throne;
all within me cries out in praise.
 Your majesty, I can but bow.
 I lay my all before You now.
In royal robes I don’t deserve
      I live to serve Your majesty,
      I live to serve Your majesty.
