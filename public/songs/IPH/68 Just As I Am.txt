   IPH 68
Just As I Am
   Just as I am, without one plea
  but that You died to set me free,
and at Your bidding, ‘Come to me!’
      O Lamb of God, I come.
    Just as I am, without delay
   Your call of mercy I obey –
Your blood can wash my sins away:
     O Lamb of God, I come.
 Just as I am, though tossed about
with many a conflict, many a doubt,
fightings within and fears without:
     O Lamb of God, I come.
Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind!
Sight, riches, healing of the mind –
   all that I need, in You to find:
      O Lamb of God, I come.
 Just as I am! You will receive,
 will welcome, pardon, cleanse,
              relieve:
because Your promise I believe,
    O Lamb of God, I come.
 Just as I am! Your love unknown
  has broken every barrier down:
now to be Yours, yes, Yours alone,
       Lamb of God, I come.
    Just as I am! Of that free love
the breadth, length, depth and height
               to prove,
   here for a time and then above,
      O Lamb of God, I come.
