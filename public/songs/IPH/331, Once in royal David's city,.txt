Once In Royal David's City
 Once in royal David's city,
 Stood a lowly cattle shed,
Where a mother laid her Baby,
  In a manger for His bed:
Mary was that mother mild,
Jesus Christ, her little Child.
He came down to earth from
          heaven,
Who is God and Lord of all,
And His shelter was a stable,
   And His cradle was a stall:
 With the poor, and mean, and
             lowly,
Lived on earth our Saviour holy.
  And through all His wondrous
           childhood
   He would honour and obey,
love and watch the gentle mother
 In whose tender arms He lay:
Christian children all should be
  kind, obedient, good as He.
For He is our childhood's pattern:
  Day by day like us He grew;
He was little, weak, and helpless,
  Tears and smiles, like us He
               knew:
And He feels for all our sadness,
And he shares in all our gladness.
  And our eyes at last shall see
              Him,
  Through His own redeeming
              love;
For that Child so dear and gentle,
  Is our Lord in heaven above:
 And He leads His children on,
To the place where He has gone.
 Not in that poor lowly stable
   with the oxen standing by,
we shall see Him, but in Heaven,
set at God’s right hand on high:
     There his children gather round
       bright like stars, with glory
                 crowned.
