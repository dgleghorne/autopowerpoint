     IPH 61
Approach My Soul
Approach, my soul, the mercy-
            seat,
 where Jesus answers prayer;
and humbly fall before His feet
  for none can perish there.
Your promise is my only plea;
      to You alone I cry,
for burdened souls in You are
             free
   and such, O Lord, am I.
Bowed down beneath the weight
             of sin,
    by Satan sorely pressed,
  from outward foes and fears
             within,
     I come to You for rest.
Lord, be my shield and hiding-
             place,
that, sheltered near Your side,
 I may my fierce accuser face
  and tell him You have died.
   Amazing love, to bleed and die,
     to bear the cross and shame,
      that guilty sinners such as I
   might plead Your gracious name!
