The Bible Tells of God’s Great
             Plan
The Bible tells of God’s great
              plan
   for people everywhere,
that all should learn to live in
              love
  and in his kingdom share.
He sent His Son, Lord Jesus
           Christ,
  to show His love for all,
 and many people followed
           Christ
    in answer to his call.
As God spoke then to men of
              old,
  So still He speaks today,
we pray that we may learn His
               will
    and follow in his way.
