         IPH 227
Praise my soul the King of
         Heaven
 Praise, my soul, the King of
           heaven,
to His feet your tribute bring;
ransomed, healed, restored,
           forgiven,
who like me His praise should
             sing?
 Praise Him! Praise Him!
 Praise Him! Praise Him!
Praise the everlasting King.
Praise Him for His grace and
            favour
  to our fathers in distress;
praise Him, still the same for
             ever,
slow to anger, swift to bless.
Praise Him! Praise Him!
Praise Him! Praise Him!
glorious in His faithfulness
             Women:
 Father-like He tends and spares
                us,
 well our human frame He knows;
In His hands He gentles bears us,
   rescues us from all our foes.
           All:
Praise Him! Praise Him!
Praise Him! Praise Him!
widely as His mercy flows.
 Frail as summerâ€™s flower we
            flourish;
blows the wind and it is gone;
  but, while mortals rise and
             perish,
God endures unchanging on.
 Praise Him! Praise Him!
 Praise Him! Praise Him!
Praise the high eternal One.
Angels, help us to adore Him;
you behold Him face to face;
 sun and moon, bow down
         before Him,
  all who dwell in time and
           space.
          Praise Him! Praise Him!
          Praise Him! Praise Him!
          Praise with us the God of
                    grace.
