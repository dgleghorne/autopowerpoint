How Sweet The Name Of
     Jesus Sounds
 How sweet the name of Jesus
             sounds
       in a believer’s ear!
It soothes his sorrows, heals his
             wounds,
    and drives away his fear.
 It makes the wounded spirit
             whole,
and calms the troubled breast:
‘tis manna to the hungry soul,
     and to the weary rest
     and to the weary rest.
Dear Name, the rock on which I
            build,
 my shield, and hiding-place;
my never-failing treasury, filled
with boundless stores of grace.
Jesus, my Shepherd, Saviour,
           Friend,
my Prophet, Priest, and King;
 my Lord, my Life, my Way,
          my End,
  accept the praise I bring,
  accept the praise I bring.
Weak is the effort of my heart,
and cold my warmest thought;
but when I see You as You are,
  I’ll praise You as I ought.
  I would Your boundless love
             proclaim
    with every fleeting breath;
so shall the music of Your name
    refresh my soul in death,
     refresh my soul in death.
