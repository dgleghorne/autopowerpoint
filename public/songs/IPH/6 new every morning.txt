      IPH 6
New Every Morning
  New every morning is the love
 our waking and our rising prove:
through sleep and darkness safely
             brought,
  restored to life and power and
             thought.
 New mercies, each returning day,
surround Your people as they pray:
new perils past, new sins forgiven,
 new thoughts of God, new hopes
            of heaven.
    If in our daily life our mind
    be set to hallow all we find,
new treasures still, of countless price,
   God will provide for sacrifice.
The trivial round, the common task,
 will furnish all we ought to ask:
 Room to deny ourselves - a road
   to bring us daily nearer God
  Prepare us, Lord in Your dear love
   for perfect rest with You above,
    and help us, this and every day,
  to grow more like you as we pray.
