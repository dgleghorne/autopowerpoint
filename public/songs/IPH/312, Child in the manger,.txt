      IPH 312
Child In The Manger
Child in the manger,
  Infant of Mary;
outcast and stranger
    Lord of all!
  Child who inherits
all our transgressions,
    all our demerits
      on Him fall.
Once the most holy
Child of salvation
 gentle and lowly
   lived below;
now, as our glorious
 mighty Redeemer,
 see Him victorious
   oâ€™er each foe.
Prophets foretold Him,
   Infant of wonder;
  angels behold Him
     on His throne;
                 worthy our Saviour
                 of all their praises;
                   happy for ever
                    are His own.
