        IPH 95
Now Thank We All Our God
   Now thank we all our God
with hearts and hands and voices;
   such wonders He has done!
    In Him the world rejoices,
who, from our mothers’ arms,
 has blessed us on our way
 with countless gifts of love
   and still is ours today.
  So may this generous God
through all our life be near us:
   to fill our hearts with joy
and with His peace to cheer us;
    to keep us in His grace
and guide us when perplexed;
     to free us from all ills
  in this world and the next.
All praise and thanks to God
who reigns in highest heaven,
    to Father and to Son
 and Spirit now be given –
          the one eternal God,
     whom earth and heaven adore –
          for so it was, is now
     and shall be evermore. Amen.
