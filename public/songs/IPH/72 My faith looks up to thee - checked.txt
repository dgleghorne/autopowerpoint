My Faith Looks Up To Thee
My faith looks up to Thee,
 Thou Lamb of Calvary,
     Saviour divine:
now hear me while I pray;
take all my guilt away;
O let me from this day
   be wholly Thine.
 May Thy rich grace impart
strength to my fainting heart,
       my zeal inspire;
  as Thou hast died for me,
   O may my love to Thee
pure, warm, and changeless be,
         a living fire.
While life’s dark maze I tread,
and griefs around me spread,
     be Thou my guide;
  bid darkness turn to day,
wipe sorrow’s tears away,
  nor let me ever stray
    from Thee aside.
  When ends life’s transient
            dream,
when death’s cold, sullen stream
      shall o’er me roll,
         blest Saviour, then, in love,
          fear and distrust remove;
            O bear me safe above,
               a ransomed soul.
