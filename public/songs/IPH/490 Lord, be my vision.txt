     IPH 490
Lord, Be My Vision
  Lord, be my vision, supreme in
              my heart,
bid every rival give way and depart:
You my best thought in the day
        or the night,
  waking or sleeping, Your
     presence my light.
Lord, be my wisdom and be my
           true word,
 I ever with You and You with
           me, Lord:
You my great Father and I Your
           true child,
  once far away, but by love
          reconciled.
   Lord, be my breastplate, my
       sword for the fight:
be my strong armour, for You are
            my might;
You are my shelter, and You my
         high tower –
raise me to heaven, O power of
          my power.
  I need no riches, nor earth’s
         empty praise:
You my inheritance though all my
              days;
   all of Your treasure to me You
               impart,
high King of heaven, the first in my
                heart.
High King of heaven, when battle
             is done,
 grant heaven’s joy to me, bright
          heaven’s Sun;
  Christ of my own heart, whatever
                 befall
  still be my vision, O Ruler of all.
