           IPH 26
Let Us With A Gladsome Mind
 Let us with a gladsome mind
praise the Lord, for He is kind:
 For His mercy shall endure,
    ever faithful, ever sure.
Let us blaze His name abroad,
  for of gods He is the God:
 For His mercy shall endure,
   ever faithful, ever sure.
    He with all-commanding might
filled the new-made world with light.
     For His mercy shall endure,
        ever faithful, ever sure.
He has caused the golden sun
all the day his course to run.
For His mercy shall endure,
   ever faithful, ever sure.
And the moon to shine by night
 with her starry sisters bright.
 For His mercy shall endure,
   ever faithful, ever sure.
 All things living He can feed,
His full hand supplies their need.
  For His mercy shall endure,
     ever faithful, ever sure.
  Let us then with gladsome mind
  praise the Lord, for He is kind:
   For His mercy shall endure,
      ever faithful, ever sure.
