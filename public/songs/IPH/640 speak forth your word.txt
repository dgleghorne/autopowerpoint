Speak Forth Your Word
Speak forth Your word, O Father,
   our hungry minds to feed,
  the people starve and perish,
  and cannot name their need;
for Lord, You have so made us
    that not alone by bread,
 but by Your word of comfort
    our hunger must be fed.
    The secrets of the atom,
      the universe of light,
    all wonders of creation
proclaim Your boundless might:
but only through the witness
 from one to one passed on
  do You reveal in fullness
   the gospel of Your Son.
To each one in their language
  to each one in their home,
 by many paths and channels
the faith of Christ may come:
   the printed word on paper,
  the wave that spans the air,
the screen, the stage, the picture
    may all its truth declare.
How shall they hear Your message
  if there are none to preach?
How shall they learn Your lesson
   if there are none to teach?
     Take us, then, Lord, and use us
       to tell what we have heard,
      and all the minds of millions
       shall feed upon Your word.
