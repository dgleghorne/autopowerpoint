         IPH 449
Crown Him With Many Crowns
Crown Him with many crowns,
  the Lamb upon His throne,
while heaven’s eternal anthem
            drowns
     all music but its own!
   Awake, my soul, and sing
     of Him who died to be
your Saviour and your matchless
             King
      through all eternity.
Crown Him the Lord of life,
 triumphant from the grave,
who rose victorious from the
            strife
 for those He came to save:
  His glories now we sing
who died and reigns on high;
He died eternal life to bring
and lives that death may die.
 Crown Him the Lord of love,
who shows His hands and side,
those wounds yet visible above
      in beauty glorified.
      No angel in the sky
    can fully bear that sight,
but downward bends his burning
               eye
     at mysteries so bright.
Crown Him the Lord of peace,
    His kingdom is at hand;
 from pole to pole let warfare
            cease,
  and Christ rule every land!
     A city stands on high,
      His glory it displays,
and there the nations ‘Holy’ cry
   in joyful hymns of praise.
Crown Him the Lord of years,
    the Potentate of time,
Creator of the rolling spheres,
     in majesty sublime:
      all hail, Redeemer, hail,
     for You have died for me;
  Your praise shall never, never fail
        through all eternity!
