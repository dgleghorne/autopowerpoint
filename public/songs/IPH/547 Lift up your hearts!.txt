       IPH 547
‘Lift up your hearts!’
‘Lift up your hearts!’ We lift them
            to the Lord,
and give to God our thanks with
           one accord;
it is our joy and duty, all our days
   to lift our hearts in grateful
        thanks and praise.
Above the level of the former
            years,
the mire of sin, the slough of
         guilty fears,
the mist of doubt, the blight of
          love’s decay –
O Lord of light, lift all our hearts
               today!
Lift every gift that You Yourself
           have given;
low lies the best till lifted up to
             heaven:
 low lie the bounding heart, the
          teeming brain,
till, sent from God, they mount to
            God again.
Then, as the trumpet-call, in after
              years,
   ‘Lift up your hearts!’ rings
       pealing in our ears,
   Still shall those hearts respond
                      with full accord,
   ‘We lift them up, we lift them to
                              the Lord!’

Henry Montague Butler, 1833 – 1918         CCLI 128675
