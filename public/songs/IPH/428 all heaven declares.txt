      IPH 428
All Heaven Declares
    All heaven declares
the glory of the risen Lord.
     Who can compare
with the beauty of the Lord?
    Forever He will be
the Lamb upon the throne.
  I gladly bow the knee
 and worship Him alone.
      I will proclaim
the glory of the risen Lord.
    Who once was slain
 to reconcile man to God.
                Forever You will be
             the Lamb upon the throne.
               I gladly bow the knee
              and worship You alone.
