     IPH 210
I’m Special Because
 I’m special because God has
          loved me,
for He gave the best thing that
      He had to save me.
 His own Son Jesus, crucified to
           take the blame,
for all the bad things I have done.
Thank you Jesus, thank you Lord,
      for loving me so much.
 I know I don’t deserve anything,
 help me feel Your love right now
   to know deep in my heart that
      I’m Your special friend
