Jesus Christ Is Risen Today
Jesus Christ is risen today,
         Alleluia.
 our triumphant holy day,
         Alleluia.
who did once, upon the cross,
          Alleluia.
 suffer to redeem our loss.
          Alleluia.
  Hymns of joy then let us sing,
             Alleluia.
praising Christ, our heavenly king,
             Alleluia.
who endured the cross and grave,
            Alleluia.
  sinners to redeem and save.
            Alleluia.
But the pains which He endured
            Alleluia.
 our salvation have procured;
            Alleluia.
now above the sky Heâ€™s king,
          Alleluia.
 where the angels ever sing.
          Alleluia.
Sing we to our God above
         Alleluia.
praise eternal as His love;
         Alleluia.
  praise Him all the heavenly host,
              Alleluia.
Father, Son and Holy Ghost. Alleluia.
