Stand Up Stand Up For Jesus
Stand up, stand up for Jesus,
   as soldiers of the cross;
  lift high His royal banner,
     it must not suffer loss;
  from victory on to victory
    His army He shall lead
till every foe is vanquished
 and Christ is Lord indeed.
Stand up, stand up for Jesus,
    the trumpet call obey
  to join the mighty conflict
   in this His glorious day!
You that are His, now serve Him
   Against unnumbered foes;
  let courage rise with danger
   and strength with strength
            oppose
Stand up, stand up for Jesus,
 stand in His strength alone:
for human power will fail you,
 you dare not trust your own
Put on the gospel armour,
 keep watch with constant
         prayer;
where duty calls or danger,
  be never failing there.
Stand up, stand up for Jesus,
  the strife will not be long:
 this day the noise of battle,
  the next the victors song.
        To everyone who conquers
          a crown of life shall be;
         we with the King of glory
           shall reign eternally.
