The Wise Man Built His House
      Upon The Rock
The wise man built his house upon
           the rock.
The wise man built his house upon
           the rock.
The wise man built his house upon
              the rock
and the rain came tumbling down.
 And the rain came down and the
          floods came up,
the rain came down and the floods
              came up,
the rain came down and the floods
             came up,
  and the house on the rock stood
               firm.
The foolish man built his house
        upon the sand.
The foolish man built his house
        upon the sand.
 The foolish man built his house
          upon the sand
and the rain came tumbling down.
 And the rain came down and the
          floods came up,
the rain came down and the floods
              came up,
the rain came down and the floods
            came up,
and the house on the sand fell flat.
