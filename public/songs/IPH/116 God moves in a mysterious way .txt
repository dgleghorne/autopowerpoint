          IPH 116
God moves in a mysterious way
God moves in a mysterious way,
   His wonders to perform;
He plants his footsteps in the sea
   and rides upon the storm
  Deep in unfathomable mines
      of never-failing skill
He treasures up his bright designs
 and works his sovereign will.
You fearful saints, fresh courage take;
    the clouds you so much dread
 are big with mercy, and shall break
      in blessings on your head.
Judge not the Lord by feeble sense,
    but trust him for his grace;
  behind a frowning providence
     He hides a smiling face.
   His purpose will ripen fast,
     unfolding every hour;
the bud may have a bitter taste,
  but sweet will be the flower.
       Blind unbelief is sure to err
       and scan His work in vain;
       God is His own interpreter
        and he will make it plain.
