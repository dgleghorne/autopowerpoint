You Servants of God
You servants of God, your
    master proclaim,
 and publish abroad His
    wonderful name;
the name all – victorious of
         Jesus extol,
His kingdom is glorious, and
        rules over all
 God rules in the height,
     almighty to save –
though hid from our sight,
  His presence we have;
the great congregation His
     triumph shall sing,
ascribing salvation to Jesus
          our King.
‘Salvation to God who sits
     on the throne!”
  Let all cry aloud, and
     honour the Son;
   the praises of Jesus the
       angels proclaim,
fall down on their faces and
      worship the Lamb
Then let us all adore and
     give Him His right
 all glory and power, all
   wisdom and might,
      all honour and blessing –
         with angels above –
     and thanks never ceasing,
           and infinite love.
