      IPH 235
Sing praise to the Lord
Sing praise to the Lord!
Praise Him in the height;
  rejoice in His Word
   you angels of light:
 you heavens, adore Him
by whom you were made,
 and worship before Him
  in brightness arrayed.
Sing praise to the Lord!
Praise Him upon earth
   in tuneful accord,
you saints of new birth:
 praise Him who has
     brought you
His grace from above;
 praise Him who has
      taught you
 to sing of His love.
 Sing praise to the Lord!
All things that give sound,
    each jubilant chord
      re-echo around:
 loud organs, His glory
 proclaim in deep tone,
and sweet harp, the story
  of what He has done.
Sing praise to the Lord!
Thanksgiving and song
 to Him be outpoured
    all ages along:
  for love in creation,
  for heaven restored,
 for grace of salvation,
sing praise to the Lord!
    (Amen, Amen.)


                   Henry Williams Baker, 1821-1877
