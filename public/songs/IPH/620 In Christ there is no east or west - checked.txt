           IPH 620
In Christ There Is No East or
             West
In Christ there is no east or west,
    in Him no south or north,
 but one great fellowship of love
throughout the whole wide earth.
  In Christ shall true hearts
          everywhere
 their high communion find.
His service is the golden cord
 close – binding humankind
Join hands, disciples of the faith,
   whate’er your race may be.
 All children of the living God
      are surely kin to me.
    In Christ now meet both east and
                   west,
       in Him meet south and north.
   all Christlike souls are one in Him,
    throughout the whole wide earth.
