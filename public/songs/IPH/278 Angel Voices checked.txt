Angel Voices
 Angel voices ever singing
round Your throne of light,
 angel music ever ringing
  rests not day or night;
thousands only live to bless You
       and confess You
        Lord of might.
Lord, beyond our mortal sight in
         glory far away,
  can it be that You delight in
     sinners’ songs today;
may we know that You are near
             us
      and will hear us?
       Yes, we may!
Yes, we know Your heart rejoices
      in each work divine,
   using minds and hands and
             voices
   in Your great design;
craftsman’s art and music’s
          measure
     for Your pleasure
        all combine.
Here to You, great God, we offer
       praise in harmony,
and for Your acceptance proffer
         all unworthily
hearts and minds and hands and
             voices
         in our choicest
           psalmody.
Honour, glory, might and merit
  for Your works and ways,
 Father, Son and Holy Spirit,
  God through endless days!
         With the best that You have
                    given
              earth and heaven
                render praise.
