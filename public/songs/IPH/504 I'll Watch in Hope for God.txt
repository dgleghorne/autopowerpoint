         IPH 504
I’ll watch in hope for God
I’ll watch in hope for God,
my Saviour and my Lord;
though evil seems to reign
      I’ll trust His constant word.
I shall not fear! Though friends betray,
 in faith I’ll pray, my God shall hear!
   Although I often fall
  or stumble in the night,
my God shall raise me up –
       the Lord will be my light.
Through my distress He’ll plead for me
  and I shall see His righteousness.
The Lord will put to shame
 the mocker’s idle boast;
God’s kingdom shall extend,
     expand from coast to coast.
From every shore they’ll come to sing
    of Israel’s King for evermore.
Shepherd Your flock, O God!
And nourish us once more;
 reveal Your wondrous acts
       as You revealed before.
 Your enemies shall see Your power,
and trembling, cower, upon their knees.
There is no God like You,
who pardons and forgives,
whose anger does not last,
       whose mercy ever lives!
  We can be sure on history’s page,
through every age, Your word endures.
