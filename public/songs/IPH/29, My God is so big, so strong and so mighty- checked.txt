    IPH 29
My God Is So Big
 My God is so big, so strong and
            so mighty,
there’s nothing that He cannot do.
 My God is so big, so strong and
            so mighty,
there’s nothing that He cannot do.
The rivers are His, the mountains
              are His,
 the stars are His handiwork too.
 My God is so big, so strong and
            so mighty,
there’s nothing that He cannot do.
 My God is so big, so strong and
            so mighty,
there’s nothing that He cannot do.
 My God is so big, so strong and
            so mighty,
there’s nothing that He cannot do.
He’s called you to live, for Him
            every day,
in all that you say and you do.
 My God is so big, so strong and
            so mighty,
 He can do all things through you.
