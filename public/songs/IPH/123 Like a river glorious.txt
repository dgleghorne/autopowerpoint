      IPH 123
Like A River Glorious
 Like a river glorious
is Gods perfect peace,
  over all victorious,
 in its bright increase
perfect, yet still flowing
    fuller every day;
perfect yet still growing
  deeper all the way.
 Trusting in the Father
hearts are truly blessed,
finding as He promised
 perfect peace and rest
   Hidden in the hollow
    of His mighty hand
where no harm can follow,
 in His strength we stand:
     we may trust fully
      all for us to do;
those who trust Him wholly
   find Him wholly true
                Trusting in the Father
               hearts are truly blessed,
               finding as He promised
                perfect peace and rest
