 IPH 472
Holy Spirit
     Holy Spirit, ever living
    As the Church’s very life;
    Holy Spirit, ever striving
through her in the ceaseless strife;
    Holy Spirit, ever forming
    in the Church the mind of
             Christ;
   You we praise with endless
             worship
for Your fruit and gifts unpriced.
   Holy Spirit, ever working
through the Church’s ministry;
 quickening, strengthening and
           absolving,
  setting captive sinners free;
       Holy Spirit, ever binding
      age to age, and soul to soul;
       in a fellowship unending,
      You we worship and extol.
