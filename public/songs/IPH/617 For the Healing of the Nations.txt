For the Healing of the Nations
For the healing of the nations,
Lord, we pray with one accord,
  for a just and equal sharing
of the things that earth affords.
 To a life of love in action
help us rise and pledge our
            word
  Lead us forward into freedom,
from despair Your world release,
   that, redeemed from war and
              hatred,
  all may come and go in peace.
Show us how through care and
             goodness
fear will die and hope increase.
  All that kills abundant living,
let it from the earth be banned:
      pride of status, race or
             schooling,
dogmas that obscure Your plan.
In our common quest for justice
may we hallow life's brief span.
 You, Creator God, have written
your great Name on humankind;
for our growing in your likeness
 bring the life of Christ to mind;
that by our response and
          service
earth its destiny may find.
