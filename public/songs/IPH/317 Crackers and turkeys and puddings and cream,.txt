Crackers And Turkeys
  Crackers and turkeys and
    puddings and cream,
toys in the windows that I’ve
          never seen.
    This is the Christmas that
          everyone sees,
but Christmas means more to me.
It’s somebody’s birthday I won’t
              forget,
  as I open the things that I get.
I’ll remember the inn and the
        stable so bare,
and Jesus who once lay there.
Everyone’s out shopping late
        every night,
for candles and presents and
    Christmas tree lights.
    This is the Christmas that
          everyone sees,
but Christmas means more to me.
It’s somebody’s birthday I won’t
              forget,
  as I open the things that I get.
I’ll remember the inn and the
        stable so bare,
and Jesus who once lay there.
 Christmas morning, the start of
             the day,
there’s presents to open and new
          games to play.
    This is the Christmas that
          everyone sees,
but Christmas means more to me.
It’s somebody’s birthday I won’t
              forget,
  as I open the things that I get.
    I’ll remember the inn and the
            stable so bare,
    and Jesus who once lay there.
