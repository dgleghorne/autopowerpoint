            IPH 85
God Is Our Strength And Refuge
 God is our strength and refuge,
  our present help in trouble;
 and we therefore will not fear,
though the earth should change!
  Though mountains shake and
            tremble,
though swirling floods are raging,
 God the Lord of hosts is with us
           evermore!
 There is a flowing river,
 within God’s holy city;
God is in the midst of her –
 she shall not be moved!
  God’s help is swiftly given,
thrones vanish at His presence –
God the Lord of hosts is with us
           evermore!
Come, see the works of our maker,
 learn of His deeds all-powerful:
 wars will cease across the world
   when He shatters the spear!
     Be still and know your creator,
       uplift Him in the nations –
     God the Lord of hosts is with us
                evermore!
