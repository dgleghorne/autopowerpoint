     IPH 253
Our Heavenly Father
Our heavenly Father, through
          Your Son,
 all hallowed be your Name;
Your Kingdom come, Your will be
              done
  in heaven and earth the same.
You are the great provider, Lord,
  of bread by which we live.
We are the great forgetters, Lord,
  of thanks for all You give.
 You are the forgiver, Lord
  of all our constant sin.
We are the unforgivers, Lord,
  of all our kith and kin.
You are the great deliverer, Lord,
   from Satan’s evil snares.
Give us the faith that trusts You,
              Lord,
    to banish all our cares.
You are the great example, where
   You give and You forgive;
 so teach us, Lord, to live Your
             prayer,
     that we may truly live.
