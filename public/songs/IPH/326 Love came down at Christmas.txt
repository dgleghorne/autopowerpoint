Love Came Down At Christmas
Love came down at Christmas,
 Love all lovely, Love divine;
Love was born at Christmas –
Star and angels gave the sign.
  Worship we the Godhead
 Love incarnate, love divine;
   worship we our Jesus –
what shall be our sacred sign?
      Love shall be our token,
  love be yours and love be mine;
    love to God and neighbour,
 love for prayer and gift and sign.
