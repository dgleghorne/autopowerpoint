Lord Jesus Christ, You Have
        Come To Us
Lord Jesus Christ, You have come to
                  us,
  You are one with us, Mary’s Son;
cleansing our souls from all their sin,
 pouring Your love and goodness in:
  Jesus, our love for You we sing –
             living Lord!
Lord Jesus Christ, You have come to
                  us,
  born as one of us, Mary’s Son;
      led out to die on Calvary,
   risen from death to set us free:
   living Lord Jesus, help us see
            You are Lord!
Lord Jesus Christ, I would come to
                  You,
 live my life for You, Son of God;
all Your commands I know are true,
Your many gifts will make me new:
   into my life Your power breaks
               through –
             living Lord!
     Lord Jesus Christ, now and every
                     day
    teach us how to pray, Son of God;
      You have commanded us to do
   this in remembrance, Lord, of You:
     into our lives Your power breaks
                  through –
                living Lord!
