As We Seek Your Face
     As we seek Your face,
   may we know Your heart,
feel Your presence, acceptance,
     as we seek Your face.
     Move among us now,
   come, reveal Your power,
show Your presence, acceptance,
     move among us now.
            At Your feet we fall,
               sovereign Lord,
            we cry, ‘Holy, holy,’
            at Your feet we fall.
