     IPH 242
To God Be The Glory
To God be the glory, great things
         He has done!
 so loved He the world that He
        gave us His son,
who yielded His life an atonement
            for sin,
 who opened the life-gate that all
           may go in:
Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!
  Let the earth hear His voice!
Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!
     Let the people rejoice!
O come to the Father, through
        Jesus the Son;
and give Him the Glory – great
     things He has done!
   O perfect redemption, the
       purchase of blood,
to every believer the promise of
              God!
  For every offender who truly
believes, that moment from Jesus
       a pardon receives:
Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!
  Let the earth hear His voice!
Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!
     Let the people rejoice!
O come to the Father, through
        Jesus the Son;
and give Him the Glory – great
     things He has done!
Great things He has taught us,
  great things He has done,
and great our rejoicing through
        Jesus the Son;
but purer, and higher, and greater
              will be
  the joy and the wonder, when
           Jesus we see:
Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!
  Let the earth hear His voice!
Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!
     Let the people rejoice!
   O come to the Father, through
           Jesus the Son;
   and give Him the Glory – great
        things He has done!
