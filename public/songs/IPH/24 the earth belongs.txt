     IPH 24
The Earth Belongs
The earth belongs unto the Lord,
    and all that it contains;
  the world that is inhabited,
   and all that there remains.
For the foundations of the same
     He on the seas did lay,
  and He hath it established
    upon the floods to stay.
Who is the man that shall ascend
     into the hill of God?
 Or who within His holy place
   Shall have a firm abode?
Whose hands are clean, whose
        heart is pure,
       and unto vanity
who hath not lifted up his soul,
   nor sworn deceitfully.
This is the man who shall receive
   the blessing from the Lord;
 the God of his salvation shall
    him righteousness accord,
    This is the generation who
      do after Him enquire;
they Jacob are, who seek Thy face
  with their whole heartsâ€™ desire.
Ye gates, lift up your heads on
              high;
  ye doors, that last for aye,
 be lifted up, that so the King
      of glory enter may.
 But who of glory is the King?
    The mighty Lord is this;
even that same Lord that great in
             might
     and strong in battle is.
Ye gates, lift up your heads; ye
              doors,
  doors that do last for aye,
 be lifted up, that so the King
      of glory enter may.
  But who is he that is the King
      of Glory? who is this?
The Lord of hosts, and none but he,
       the King of glory is.
