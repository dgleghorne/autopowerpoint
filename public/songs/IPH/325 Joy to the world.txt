     IPH 325
Joy To The World
 Joy to the World - the Lord has
               come:
    Let earth receive her King,
Let every heart prepare Him room
   And Heaven and nature sing,
   And Heaven and nature sing,
And Heaven, and Heaven, and nature
              sing!
 Joy to the World - the Saviour
              reigns:
 Your sweetest songs employ,
While fields and streams, and hills
            and plains
   Repeat the sounding joy,
   Repeat the sounding joy,
Repeat, repeat, the sounding joy!
He rules the world with truth and
             grace,
 And makes the nations prove
The glories of His righteousness
   And wonders of His love,
   And wonders of His love,
And wonder, wonders of His love.
