      IPH 644
At The Name Of Jesus
  At the name of Jesus
 Every knee shall bow,
Every tongue confess him
   King of glory now:
This the Father's pleasure
 That we call him Lord,
Who from the beginning
 Was the mighty Word.
 At His voice creation
Sprang at once to sight,
 All the angels faces
 All the hosts of light,
Thrones and Dominations,
  Stars upon their way,
 All the heavenly orders,
   In their great array.
Humbled for a season,
  To receive a name
From the lips of sinners
 Unto whom he came,
   Faithfully He bore it
   Spotless to the last,
Brought it back victorious,
When from death He passed:
    Bore it up triumphant
    With its human light,
Through all ranks of creatures,
    To the central height,
To the eternal Godhead,
 To the Father's throne,
 Filled it with the glory
  Of His triumph won.
Name Him, Christians, name Him,
   With love strong as death,
   But with awe and wonder
    And with bated breath:
He is God the Saviour,
He is Christ the Lord,
Ever to be worshipped,
 Trusted, and adored.
In your hearts enthrone him;
    There let him subdue
     All that is not holy,
     All that is not true:
Crown Him as your captain
   In temptation's hour;
  Let His will enfold you
  In its light and power.
With His Fatherâ€™s glory
  Jesus comes again,
Angel hosts attend Him
And announce His reign;
          For all wreaths of empire
           Meet upon His brow,
         And our hearts confess Him
            King of glory now.
