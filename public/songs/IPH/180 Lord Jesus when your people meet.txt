          IPH 180
Lord Jesus, when Your people
            meet
 Lord Jesus, when Your people
             meet
 they come before Your mercy-
              seat;
Where You are sought, You shall
           be found,
and every place is holy ground.
   Your presence, by no walls
             confined,
   is known within the humble
               mind;
 the meek will bring You where
            they come
and going take You to their home.
Great Shepherd of Your chosen
              few;
Your former mercies here renew;
   here to our waiting hearts
            proclaim
 the greatness of Your saving
             name.
  Here may we prove the power of
                prayer
  to strengthen faith and sweeten
                 care;
  to teach our faint desires to rise
and bring all heaven before our eyes.
 Lord, we are few, but You are
             near;
Your arm can save, Your ear can
             hear:
break through the heavens, come
         quickly down,
and make a thousand hearts Your
             own!
