            IPH 531
I’m Not Ashamed to Own My Lord
I’m not ashamed to own my Lord,
     or to defend His cause,
  maintain the glory of His cross,
     and honour all His laws
Jesus, my Lord! I know His name,
    His name is all my boast;
nor will He put my soul to shame,
      nor let my hope be lost
I know that safe with Him remains,
     protected by His power,
 what I’ve committed to His trust,
       till the decisive hour.
    Then will He own His servant’s
                name
       before His Father’s face,
      and in the new Jerusalem
       appoint my soul a place.
