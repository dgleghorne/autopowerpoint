Name Of All Majesty
Name of all majesty,
fathomless mystery,
  King of the ages
 by angels adored;
 power and authority,
splendour and dignity,
 bow to His mastery,
    Jesus is Lord!
Child of our destiny,
 God from eternity,
  love of the Father
on sinners outpoured;
see now what God has done
   sending His only Son,
  Christ the beloved One,
       Jesus is Lord!
Saviour of Calvary,
  costliest victory,
 darkness defeated
and Eden restored;
  born as a Man to die,
nailed to a cross on high,
 cold in the grave to lie,
      Jesus is Lord!
Source of all sovereignty,
   light, immortality,
     life everlasting
  and heaven assured;
          so with the ransomed, we
            praise Him eternally,
            Christ in His majesty,
                Jesus is Lord!
