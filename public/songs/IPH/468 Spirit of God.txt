  IPH 468
Spirit Of God
Spirit of God, our hearts inspire,
  let us Your influence prove,
Source of the old prophetic fire,
   Fountain of light and love.
  Come, Holy Spirit, Lord, by
             whom
 the prophets wrote and spoke:
the Key to all God’s truth, now
             come,
    unseal the sacred Book.
O spread your wings, celestial
             Dove,
   above our nature’s night,
on our disordered spirits move,
  and let there now be light.
   God, through Himself, we then
             shall know
       if You within us shine,
   and sound, with all Your saints
               below,
     the depths of love divine.
