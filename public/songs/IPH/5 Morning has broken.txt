      IPH 5
Morning Has Broken
 Morning has broken
like the first morning;
black bird has spoken
   like the first bird.
    Praise the singing!
 Praise for the morning!
Praise for them, springing
  fresh from the Word!
Sweet the rain's new fall
  sunlit from heaven,
 like the first dewfall
   on the first grass.
Praise for the sweetness
   of the wet garden,
sprung in completeness
  where His feet pass.
Mine is the sunlight!
Mine is the morning
born of the one light
  Eden saw play!
                  Praise with elation,
                 praise every morning,
                   God's re-creation
                    of the new day!
