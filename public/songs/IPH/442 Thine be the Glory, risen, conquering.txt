     IPH 442
Thine Be The Glory
   Thine be the glory, risen,
       conquering Son,
endless is the victory Thou o’er
        death hast won;
angels in bright raiment rolled the
           stone away,
  kept the folded grave-clothes,
      where Thy body lay.
   Thine be the glory, risen,
       conquering Son,
endless is the victory Thou o’er
        death hast won.
Lo! Jesus meets us, risen from the
              tomb;
 lovingly He greets us, scatters
         fear and gloom;
let the Church with gladness
   hymns of triumph sing,
   for her Lord now liveth;
   death hath lost its sting.
   Thine be the glory, risen,
       conquering Son,
endless is the victory Thou o’er
        death hast won.
  No more we doubt Thee,
   glorious Prince of Life;
life is naught without Thee:
      aid us in our strife;
make us more than conquerors,
 through Thy deathless love:
 bring us safe through Jordan
     to Thy home above.
         Thine be the glory, risen,
             conquering Son,
      endless is the victory Thou o’er
              death hast won.
