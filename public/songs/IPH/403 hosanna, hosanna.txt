Hosanna, hosanna, hosanna in

Be exalted, O Lord our God —

Glory, glory, glory to the King of
              Kings;
glory, glory, glory to the King of
              Kings:
     Lord, we lift up Your name,
      with hearts full of praise.
    Be exalted, O Lord our God —
     glory to the King of Kings.
