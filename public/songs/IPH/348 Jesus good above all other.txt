IPH 348 Jesus, good above all
           other
Jesus, good above all other,
gentle child of gentle mother,
 in a stable born our brother,
  give us grace to persevere.
  Jesus, cradled in a manger,
   for us facing every danger,
living as a homeless stranger,
  You we make our King most
               dear.
Jesus, for your people dying,
risen Master, death defying,
 Lord in heaven, Your grace
          supplying,
  keep us to Your presence
            near.
Jesus, all our sorrows bearing,
all our thoughts and hopes still
             sharing,
to Your people truth declaring;
 help us all Your truth to hear.
        Lord, in all our doings guide
                      us;
         pride and hate shall ne’er
                  divide us;
        we’ll go on with You beside
                      us,
        and with joy we’ll persevere!
