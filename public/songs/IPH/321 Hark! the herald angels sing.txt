Hark! The Herald Angels Sing
  Hark! the herald angels sing
  glory to the new-born King;
peace on earth, and mercy mild,
  God and sinners reconciled!
  Joyful all you nations rise,
 join the triumph of the skies;
with the angelic host proclaim,
‘Christ is born in Bethlehem!’
Hark! the herald angels sing,
 glory to the newborn King.
Christ, by highest heaven adored;
  Christ, the everlasting Lord;
 late in time behold him come,
 offspring of a virgin's womb:
veiled in flesh the Godhead see,
    hail the incarnate Deity,
Pleased as man with us to dwell,
     Jesus, our Emmanuel:
Hark! the herald angels sing,
 glory to the newborn King.
 Hail the heaven-born Prince of
              Peace!
 hail the Sun of Righteousness;
 light and life to all He brings,
risen with healing in His wings.
  mild, he lays His glory by,
born that we no more may die,
born to raise us from the earth,
 born to give us second birth:
     Hark! the herald angels sing,
      glory to the newborn King.
