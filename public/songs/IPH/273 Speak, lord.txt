Speak, Lord, in the stillness,
  speak Your word to me;
   help me now to listen
      in expectancy.
 Speak, O gracious Master,
      in this quiet hour;
let me see Your face, Lord,
 feel Your touch of power.
For the words You give me,
    they are life indeed;
 living bread from heaven,
     now my spirit feed.
Speak, Your servant listens-
     I await Your word;
let me know Your presence,
  let Your voice be heard!
Fill me with the knowledge
    of Your glorious will;
all Your own good pleasure
       in my life fulfil.
