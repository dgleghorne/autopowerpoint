        IPH 551
O Jesus, I Have Promised
O Jesus, I have promised
to serve You to the end –
be now and ever near me,
my Master and my Friend:
  I shall not fear the battle
    if You are by my side,
nor wander from the pathway
   if You will be my guide.
O let me feel You near me,
   the world is ever near;
I see the sights that dazzle,
the tempting sounds I hear;
 my foes are ever near me,
  around me and within;
but Jesus, draw still nearer
and shield my soul from sin!
O let me hear You speaking
  in accents clear and still;
above the storms of passion,
   the murmurs of self-will:
  O speak to reassure me,
    to hasten or control;
and speak to make me listen,
  O Guardian of my soul.
O let me see Your footmarks
 and in them place my own;
    my hope to follow truly
  is in Your strength alone:
  O guide me, call me, draw me,
       uphold me to the end;
  and then in heaven receive me,
    my Saviour and my Friend.
