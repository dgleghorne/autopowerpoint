          IPH 221
O For A Thousand Tongues To
            Sing
O for a thousand tongues to sing
  my great Redeemer’s praise,
  my great Redeemer’s praise,
the glories of my God and King,
the triumphs of His grace!
the triumphs of His grace!
the triumphs of His grace!
Jesus, the name that charms our
              fears
  and bids our sorrows cease,
  and bids our sorrows cease;
 this music in the sinner’s ears
is life and health and peace,
is life and health and peace,
is life and health and peace.
He breaks the power of cancelled
               sin,
    He sets the prisoner free,
    He sets the prisoner free;
His blood can make the foulest
            clean,
  His blood availed for me,
  His blood availed for me,
  His blood availed for me.
He speaks - and, listening to His
             voice,
   new life the dead receive,
   new life the dead receive;
the mournful broken hearts rejoice,
     the humble poor believe,
     the humble poor believe,
     the humble poor believe.
Hear Him, you deaf! His praise,
          you dumb,
your loosened tongues employ,
your loosened tongues employ;
You blind, now see your Saviour
             come;
  and leap, you lame, for joy!
  and leap, you lame, for joy!
  and leap, you lame, for joy!
My gracious Master and my God,
     assist me to proclaim
     assist me to proclaim
and spread through all the earth
             abroad
           the honours of Your name,
           the honours of Your name,
           the honours of Your name.
