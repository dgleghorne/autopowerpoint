Brother, sister, let me
     serve you
Brother, sister, let me serve you,
   let me be as Christ to you.
Pray that I may have the grace to
   let you be my servant, too.
 We are pilgrims on a journey,
 and companions on the road;
we are here to help each other
walk the mile and bear the load.
 I will hold the Christ-light for you
    in the night-time of your fear;
   I will hold my hand out to you,
speak the peace you long to hear.
 I will weep when you are weeping;
 when you laugh I’ll laugh with you.
    I will share your joy and sorrow
till we’ve seen this journey through.
When we sing to God in heaven
  we shall find such harmony,
born of all we’ve known together
   of Christ’s love and agony.
   Won’t you let me be your servant,
      let me be as Christ to you?
   Pray that I may have the grace to
      let you be my servant, too.
