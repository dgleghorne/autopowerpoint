     IPH 33
O Worship The King
 O worship the King,
  all-glorious above;
   O gratefully sing
His power and His love:
our shield and defender,
  the Ancient of Days,
 pavilioned in splendor
and girded with praise!
  O tell of His might!
  O sing of His grace,
whose robe is the light, whose
     canopy space!
His chariots of wrath the deep
  thunder clouds form,
 and dark is His path on
 the wings of the storm.
The earth, with its store
  of wonders untold,
Almighty, Your power
  has founded of old,
  established it fast by
  a changeless decree,
and round it has cast, like
    a mantle, the sea.
 Your bountiful care
what tongue can recite?
  breathes in the air,
 it shines in the light,
it streams from the hills, it
 descends to the plain,
 and sweetly distils in
 the dew and the rain.
Frail children of dust
  and feeble as frail,
 in You do we trust,
nor find You to fail;
Your mercies how tender,
  how firm to the end;
  our maker, defender,
 redeemer, and friend!
O measureless might!
   O infinite love!
While angels delight
to praise You above,
             Your ransomed creation,
                with glory ablaze,
                with true adoration
              shall sing Your praise!
