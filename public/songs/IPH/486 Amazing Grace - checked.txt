  IPH 486
Amazing Grace
      Amazing grace –
   how sweet the sound -
that saved a wretch like me!
       I once was lost,
     but now am found,
  was blind, but now I see.
  God’s grace first taught
      my heart to fear;
His grace my fears relieved;
   how precious did that
       grace appear
 the hour I first believed!
   Through every danger,
        trial and snare
    I have already come;
   His grace has brought
       me safe thus far,
and grace will lead me home.
  The Lord has promised
        good to me,
His word my hope secures;
 my shield and stronghold
        He shall be
  as long as life endures.
           And when this earthly
                 life is past,
        and mortal cares shall cease,
            I shall possess with
                Christ at last
           eternal joy and peace.

John Newton, 1725–1807            CCLI 128675
