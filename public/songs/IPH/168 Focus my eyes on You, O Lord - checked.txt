Focus My Eyes On You
Focus my eyes on You, O Lord;
    focus my eyes on You.
To worship in spirit and in truth,
    focus my eyes on You.
Turn round my life to You, O Lord;
    turn round my life to You.
 To know from this time Youâ€™ve
          made me new,
    turn round my life to You.
    Fill up my heart with praise, O
                 Lord;
     fill up my heart with praise.
    To speak of Your love in every
                place,
     fill up my heart with praise.
