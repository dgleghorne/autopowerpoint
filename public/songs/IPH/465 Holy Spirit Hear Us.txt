      IPH 465
Holy Spirit, Hear Us
 Holy Spirit, hear us;
help us while we sing;
breathe into the music
of the praise we bring.
 Holy Spirit, prompt us
 when we kneel to pray;
nearer come, and teach us
  what we ought to say.
Holy Spirit, shine, Lord
 on the book we read;
    to its holy pages
bring the light we need.
  Holy Spirit, give us
  each a lowly mind;
make us more like Jesus,
 gentle, pure, and kind.
              Holy Spirit, help us
             daily, by Your might,
           what is wrong to conquer;
            and to choose the right.
