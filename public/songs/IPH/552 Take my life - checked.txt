  IPH 552
Take My Life
     Take my life and let it be
 all You purpose, Lord, for me;
   consecrate my passing days,
let them flow in ceaseless praise.
 Take my hands, and let them
            move
 at the impulse of Your love;
take my feet, and let them run
with the news of victory won.
Take my voice, and let me sing
   always, only, for my King;
take my lips, let them proclaim
  all the beauty of Your name.
Take my wealth — all I possess,
  make me rich in faithfulness;
  take my mind that I may use
every power as You shall choose.
 Take my motives and my will,
    all Your purpose to fulfil;
take my heart — it is Your own,
  it shall be Your royal throne.
    Take my love — my Lord, I pour
     at Your feet its treasure-store;
        take myself, and I will be
          Yours for all eternity.
