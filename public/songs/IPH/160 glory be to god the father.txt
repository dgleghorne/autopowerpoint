Glory Be To God The Father
 Glory be to God the Father,
   glory be to God the Son,
 glory be to God the Spirit, –
great Jehovah, Three-in-One!
Glory, glory, glory, glory
 while eternal ages run!
  Glory be to Him who loved us,
washed us from each spot and stain!
 Glory be to Him who bought us,
 made us kings with Him to reign!
    Glory, glory, glory, glory
to the Lamb that once was slain!
 Glory to the King of angels,
 glory to the Church’s King,
 glory to the King of nations!
heaven and earth, your praises
             bring;
 Glory, glory, glory, glory
to the King of glory bring!
 ‘Glory, blessing, praise eternal!’
  Thus the choir of angels sings;
‘Honour, riches, power, dominion!’
  Thus its praise creation brings;
            Glory, glory, glory, glory
           glory to the King of Kings!
                      Amen.
