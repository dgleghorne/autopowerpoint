         IPH 454
Rejoice, the Lord is King!
 Rejoice, the Lord is King!
 Your Lord and King adore:
mortals, give thanks and sing,
  and triumph evermore:
Lift up your heart, lift up your
            voice:
rejoice! again I say, Rejoice!
  Jesus, the Saviour, reigns,
  the God of truth and love;
when He had purged our stains
   He took His seat above:
Lift up your heart, lift up your
            voice:
rejoice! again I say, Rejoice!
   His kingdom cannot fail,
He rules both earth and heaven;
  the keys of death and hell
    are to our Jesus given:
Lift up your heart, lift up your
            voice:
rejoice! again I say, Rejoice!
He sits at God’s right hand,
   till all His foes submit
 and bow to His command
 and fall beneath His feet:
Lift up your heart, lift up your
            voice:
rejoice! again I say, Rejoice!
 Rejoice in glorious hope!
Jesus the Judge shall come
 and take His servants up
   to their eternal home:
We soon shall hear the archangel’s
              voice;
 God’s trumpet-call shall sound –
            Rejoice!
