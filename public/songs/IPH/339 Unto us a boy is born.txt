       IPH 339
Unto Us A Boy Is Born!
  Unto us a boy is born!
   King of all creation,
Came he to a world forlorn,
 The Lord of every nation,
 The Lord of every nation.
 Cradled in a stall was He
With sleepy cows and asses;
But the very beasts could see
 That He all men surpasses,
 That He all men surpasses.
Herod then with fear was filled:
“A prince,” he said, “in Jewry!”
  All the little boys he killed
   At Bethlehem in his fury,
   At Bethlehem in his fury.
Now may Mary’s son, who came
    So long ago to love us,
 Lead us all with hearts aflame
    Unto the joys above us,
    Unto the joys above us.
     Omega and Alpha he!
     Let the organ thunder,
While the choir with songs of glee
   Now rend the air asunder,
   Now rend the air asunder.
