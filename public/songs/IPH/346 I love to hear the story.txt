        IPH 346
I Love To Hear The Story
   I love to hear the story
  Which angel voices tell,
 How once the King of Glory
Came down on earth to dwell.
   I am both weak and sinful,
      But this I surely know,
The Lord came down to save me,
   Because He loved me so.
I’m glad my blessed Saviour
  Was once a child like me,
To show how pure and holy
   His little ones might be;
   And, if I try to follow
His footsteps here below,
He never will forsake me,
Because He loves me so.
 To sing His love and mercy
 My sweetest songs I’ll raise,
And, though I cannot see Him,
 I know He hears my praise;
       For He has kindly promised
           That even I may go
       To sing among His angels,
        Because He loves me so.
