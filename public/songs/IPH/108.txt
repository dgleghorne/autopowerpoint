   IPH 108
O God of Bethel
O God of Bethel, by whose hand
   Your children still are fed;
   who through this earthly
          pilgrimage
    Your people safely led:
Our vows, our prayers, we now
           present
 before Your gracious throne;
as You have been their faithful
            God,
    so always be our own!
Through each perplexing path of
               life
our wandering footsteps guide;
 give us today our daily bread,
   and for our needs provide.
              O spread your covering wings
                            around
               till all our wanderings cease,
            and at our heavenly Fatherâ€™s home
                  we shall arrive in peace.
