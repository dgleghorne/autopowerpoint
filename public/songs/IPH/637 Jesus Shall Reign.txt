    IPH 637
Jesus Shall Reign
Jesus shall reign where’er the sun
does his successive journeys run;
His kingdom stretch from shore to
               shore
  till moons shall rise and set no
               more.
 People and realms of every tongue
 declare his love in sweetest song,
and children’s voices shall proclaim
 their early blessings on His name.
   Blessings abound where Jesus
               reigns –
the prisoner leaps to lose his chains,
     the weary find eternal rest,
and all who suffer want are blessed.
To Him shall endless prayer be
             made,
and praises throng to crown His
              head;
His name like incense shall arise
 with every morning sacrifice.
    Let all creation rise and bring
   distinctive honours to our King;
   angels descend with songs again
       and earth repeat the loud
                ‘Amen!’
