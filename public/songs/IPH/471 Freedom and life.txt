Freedom And Life
 Freedom and life are ours
  for Christ has set us free!
Never again submit to powers
     that lead to slavery:
 Christ is the Lord who breaks
 our chains, our bondage ends,
Christ is the rescuer who makes
the helpless slaves His friends.
 Called by the Lord to use
our freedom and be strong,
 not letting liberty excuse
  a life of blatant wrong:
 freed from the law’s stern hand
   God’s gift of grace to prove,
know that the law’s entire demand
      is gladly met by love.
   Spirit of God, come, fill,
       emancipate us all!
Speak to us, Word of truth, until
   before His throne we fall:
         glory and liberty
     our Father has decreed,
and if the Son shall makes us free
     we shall be free indeed!
