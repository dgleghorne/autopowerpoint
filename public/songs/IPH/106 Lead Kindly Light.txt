    IPH 106
Lead Kindly Light
     Lead, kindly light, amid the
          encircling gloom,
           Oh lead me on;
 the night is dark, and I am far from
                home;
           Oh lead me on.
  Keep firm my feet; I do not ask to
                  see
the distant scene, one step enough
               for me..
I was not ever thus, nor prayed that
                 You
          should lead me on;
I loved to choose and see my path;
               but now
            Oh lead me on;
 I loved the broader way, and, spite
               of fears,
  pride ruled my will: remember not
              past years.
    So long Your power has blessed
                    me, sure it still
                   will lead me on,
     o'er moor and fen, o'er crag and
                       torrent, till
                  the night is gone;
      and with the morn those angel
                     faces smile,
  which I have loved long since, and
John Henry Newman     lost awhile.
