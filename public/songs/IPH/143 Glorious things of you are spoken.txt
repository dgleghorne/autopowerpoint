          IPH 143
Glorious Things Of You Are
          Spoken
Glorious things of you are spoken,
      Zion, city of our God;
He whose Word cannot be broken
 Formed you for His own abode:
  On the rock of ages founded,
What can shake your sure repose?
With salvation’s walls surrounded
 You may smile at all your foes.
See, the streams of living waters
  Springing from eternal love!
   Well supply your sons and
            daughters
 And all fear of want remove:
Who can faint while such a river
Ever flows their thirst to assuage?
 Grace, which like the Lord the
              giver
  Never fails from age to age.
Round each habitation hovering
 See the cloud and fire appear
  For a glory and a covering,
Showing that the Lord is near:
Thus they march, the pillar leading,
 Light by night and shade by day;
   Daily on the manna feeding
 Which He gives them when they
              pray.
 Saviour, since of Zion’s city
I through grace a member am,
 Let the world deride or pity,
   I will glory in Your name:
      Fading are the world’s best
                pleasures,
    all its boasted pomp and show;
    solid joys and lasting treasures
    none but Zion’s children know.
