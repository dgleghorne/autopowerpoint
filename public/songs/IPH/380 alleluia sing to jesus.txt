       IPH 380
Alleluia, Sing To Jesus
    Alleluia, sing to Jesus!
His the sceptre, His the throne:
 Alleluia! - His the triumph,
     His the victory alone.
  Hear the songs of holy Zion
  thunder like a mighty flood:
   ‘Jesus out of every nation
has redeemed us by His blood!’
     Alleluia! - not as orphans
    are we left in sorrow now:
     Alleluia! - He is near us;
faith believes, nor questions how.
Though the cloud from sight
        received Him
whom the angels now adore,
 shall our hearts forget His
          promise,
 ‘I am with you evermore’?
  Alleluia! - Bread of Heaven,
here on earth our food, our stay:
   Alleluia! - here the sinful
 come to You from day to day.
 Intercessor, friend of sinners,
earth’s Redeemer, plead for me,
where the songs of all the sinless
  sweep across the crystal sea.
    Alleluia, sing to Jesus!
His the sceptre, His the throne:
 Alleluia! - His the triumph,
     His the victory alone.
      Hear the songs of holy Zion
      thunder like a mighty flood:
       ‘Jesus out of every nation
    has redeemed us by His blood!’
