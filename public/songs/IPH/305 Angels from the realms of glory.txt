         IPH 305
Angels From The Realms Of
          Glory
Angels from the realms of glory,
wing your flight through all the
             earth;
  heralds of creation’s story
Now proclaim Messiah’s birth!
 Come and worship Christ,
    the new-born King;
     come and worship
worship Christ, the new-born
           King.
Shepherds in the fields abiding,
watching by your flocks at night,
  God with us is now residing:
see, there shines the infant light!
 Come and worship Christ,
    the new-born King;
     come and worship
worship Christ, the new-born
           King.
     Wise men, leave your
        contemplations!
   Brighter visions shine afar;
seek in Him the hope of nations,
 you have seen His rising star:
 Come and worship Christ,
    the new-born King;
     come and worship
worship Christ, the new-born
           King.
 Though an infant now we view
               Him,
He will share His Father’s throne,
  gather all the nations to Him;
every knee shall then bow down:
    Come and worship Christ,
       the new-born King;
        come and worship
   worship Christ, the new-born
              King.
