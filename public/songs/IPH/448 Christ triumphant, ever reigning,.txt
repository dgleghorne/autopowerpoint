     IPH 448
Christ Triumphant
Christ triumphant, ever reigning,
    Saviour, Master, King!
   Lord of heaven, our lives
           sustaining,
       hear us as we sing:
Yours the glory and the crown,
       the high renown,
      the eternal name!
Word incarnate, truth revealing,
    Son of Man on earth!
Power and majesty concealing
   by Your humble birth:
Yours the glory and the crown,
       the high renown,
      the eternal name!
Suffering Servant, scorned, ill-treated,
           victim crucified!
 Death is through the cross defeated,
           sinners justified:
Yours the glory and the crown,
       the high renown,
      the eternal name!
Priestly King, enthroned for ever
      high in heaven above!
Sin and death and hell shall never
       stifle hymns of love:
Yours the glory and the crown,
       the high renown,
      the eternal name!
So, our hearts and voices raising
     through the ages long,
 ceaselessly upon You gazing,
     this shall be our song:
   Yours the glory and the crown,
          the high renown,
         the eternal name!
