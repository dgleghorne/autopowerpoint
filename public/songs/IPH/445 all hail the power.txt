All Hail The Power
All hail the power of Jesus’ name!
      Before Him angels fall,
      Before Him angels fall.
   Bring forth the royal diadem
and crown Him, crown Him,
  crown Him, crown Him,
and crown Him Lord of all.
Crown Him, you martyrs of our God,
       who for His justice call,
       who for His justice call;
 exalt the One whose path you trod,
and crown Him, crown Him,
  crown Him, crown Him,
and crown Him Lord of all.
  Descendants of His chosen race,
      redeemed from Adam’s fall
     redeemed from Adam’s fall,
hail him who saves you by His grace,
and crown Him, crown Him,
  crown Him, crown Him,
and crown Him Lord of all.
Let every people, nation, tribe,
     on this terrestrial ball,
     on this terrestrial ball,
  to Him all majesty ascribe
       and crown Him, crown Him,
         crown Him, crown Him,
       and crown Him Lord of all.
