          IPH 390
Now let us from this table rise
  Now let us from this table rise

renewed in body, mind and soul;

with Christ we die and rise again,

  his selfless love has made us
                whole.
With minds alert, upheld by grace,

  to spread the Word in speech
           and deed,

  we follow in the steps of Christ

at one with all in hope and need.
To fill each human house with love,

    it is the sacrament of care;

 the work that Christ began to do

   we humbly pledge ourselves
           to share.
          Then grant us grace,
           Companion-God,

to choose again the pilgrim way,

 and help us to accept with joy

the challenge of tomorrow's day.
