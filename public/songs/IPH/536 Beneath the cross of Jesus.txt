Beneath The Cross Of Jesus
 Beneath the cross of Jesus
   I gladly take my stand;
the shadow of a mighty rock
     within a weary land;
  a home within the wilderness,
       a rest upon the way,
from the burning of the noontide
               heat,
    and the burden of the day.
O safe and happy shelter!
 O refuge tried and sweet!
The appointed place where
      heaven’s love
and heaven’s justice meet!
    As weary Jacob, in his sleep,
  that wondrous dream was given,
so seems my Saviour’s cross to me –
       a ladder up to heaven.
 Upon that cross of Jesus
  my eye at times can see
the very dying form of one
who suffered there for me;
and from my broken heart, with tears,
       two wonders I confess:
  the wonders of His glorious love,
        and my unworthiness.
His cross! I take its shadow
   to be my hiding-place;
I ask no other sunshine than
  the sunshine of His face;
      Content to let the world go by,
        to know no gain or loss:
      my sinful self my only shame,
        my glory all – the cross!
