  IPH 398
Come And See
  Come and see, come and see,
 come and see the King of love;
see the purple robe and crown of
        thorns He wears.
 Soldiers mock, rulers sneer
 as He lifts the cruel cross;
lone and friendless now, He
  climbs towards the hill.
   We worship at Your feet,
 where wrath and mercy meet,
and a guilty world is washed by
      love’s pure stream.
    For us He was made sin –
       O help me take it in.
   Deep wounds of love cry out,
        ‘Father, forgive.’
I worship, I worship the Lamb who
             was slain.
 Come and weep, come and mourn
for your sin that pierced Him there;
 so much deeper than the wounds
         of thorn and nail.
 All our pride, all our greed,
all our fallenness and shame;
  and the Lord has laid the
     punishment on Him.
   We worship at Your feet,
 where wrath and mercy meet,
and a guilty world is washed by
      love’s pure stream.
    For us He was made sin –
       O help me take it in.
   Deep wounds of love cry out,
        ‘Father, forgive.’
I worship, I worship the Lamb who
             was slain.
Man of Heaven, born to earth
to restore us to Your Heaven.
Here we bow in awe beneath
     Your searching eyes.
   From Your tears comes our joy,
From Your death our life shall spring;
   by Your resurrection power we
             shall rise.
   We worship at Your feet,
 where wrath and mercy meet,
and a guilty world is washed by
      love’s pure stream.
    For us He was made sin –
       O help me take it in.
   Deep wounds of love cry out,
        ‘Father, forgive.’
I worship, I worship the Lamb who
             was slain.
