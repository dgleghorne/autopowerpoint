  IPH 335
Silent Night
      Silent night, holy night!
 Sleeps the world; hid from sight,
  Mary and Joseph in stable bare
Watch o’er the Child beloved and fair,
     Sleeping in heavenly rest,
     Sleeping in heavenly rest.
    Silent night, holy night!
 Shepherds first saw the light,
Heard resounding clear and long,
 Far and near, the angel-song:
 ‘Christ the Redeemer is here,
 Christ the Redeemer is here.’
      Silent night, holy night!
     Son of God, O how bright
   Love is smiling from Thy face!
Strikes for us now the hour of grace,
    Saviour, since You are born,
    Saviour, since You are born.
