        IPH 530
Yield Not To Temptation
Yield not to temptation, for
       yielding is sin,
 each victory will help you
     some other to win;
fight steadily onward, dark
      passions subdue,
 look ever to Jesus, He will
     carry you through.
Ask the Saviour to help you,
 comfort, strengthen and
          keep you;
  He is willing to aid you,
 He will carry you through.
 Shun evil companions, bad
     language disdain,
    God’s Name hold in
reverence, nor take it in vain;
be thoughtful and earnest,
   kind-hearted and true,
 look ever to Jesus, He will
      carry you through.
Ask the Saviour to help you,
 comfort, strengthen and
          keep you;
  He is willing to aid you,
 He will carry you through.
To all the victorious, God’s gift
           is a crown;
    Through faith we shall
 conquer, though often cast
              down;
He Who is our Saviour our
   strength will renew,
look ever to Jesus, He will
   carry you through.
  Ask the Saviour to help you,
   comfort, strengthen and
            keep you;
    He is willing to aid you,
   He will carry you through.
