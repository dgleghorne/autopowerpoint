      IPH 292
Faithful vigil ended
  Faithful vigil ended,
watching, waiting cease;
Master, grant your servant
 his discharge in peace.
 All the spirit promised,
  all the Father willed,
now these eyes behold it
   perfectly fulfilled.
This your great deliverance
  sets your people free;
 Christ their light uplifted
    all the nations see.
  Christ, your peopleâ€™s glory!
   watching, doubting cease:
   grant to us your servants
    our discharge in peace.
