           IPH 650
Mine Eyes Have Seen The Glory
Mine eyes have seen the glory of
   the coming of the Lord;
He is trampling out the vintage
 Where the grapes of wrath are
            stored;
  He has loosed the fateful
lighting of His terrible swift
           sword:
  His truth is marching on.
 Glory, glory, alleluia
  glory, glory, alleluia
  glory, glory, alleluia
His truth is marching on.
   He has sounded forth the
 trumpet that shall never call
              retreat;
He is sifting out all human hearts
  before His judgement-seat;
O be swift, my soul, to answer
  Him; be jubilant, my feet!
     Our is marching on.
 Glory, glory, alleluia
  glory, glory, alleluia
  glory, glory, alleluia
Our God is marching on.
In the beauty of the lilies Christ
    was borne across the sea,
 with a glory in His bosom that
    transfigures you and me
As He died to make us holy, let us
      live that all be free,
   while God is marching on.
  Glory, glory, alleluia
   glory, glory, alleluia
   glory, glory, alleluia
while God is marching on.
He is coming like the glory of the
      morning on the wave;
He is wisdom to the mighty; He
     is succour to the brave;
  So the world shall be His
footstool, and the soul of time
           His slave:
   our God is marching on.
             Glory, glory, alleluia
              glory, glory, alleluia
              glory, glory, alleluia
            Our God is marching on.
