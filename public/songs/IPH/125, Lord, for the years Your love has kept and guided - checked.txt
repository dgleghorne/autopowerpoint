      IPH 125
Lord, For The Years
Lord, for the years Your love
   has kept and guided,
   urged and inspired us,
  cheered us on our way,
 sought us and saved us,
 pardoned and provided,
Lord of the years, we bring
    our thanks today.
 Lord, for that Word, the
Word of life which fires us,
speaks to our hearts and
  sets our souls ablaze,
teaches and trains, rebukes
     us and inspires us,
 Lord of the Word, receive
   Your peopleâ€™s praise.
Lord, for our land in this our
         generation,
    spirits oppressed by
pleasure, wealth and care;
 for young and old, for this
      and every nation,
    Lord of our land, be
pleased to hear our prayer.
 Lord, for our world; when
we disown and doubt Him,
  loveless in strength, and
    comfortless in pain;
 hungry and helpless, lost
   indeed without Him,
Lord of the world, we pray
  that Christ may reign.
Lord, for ourselves; in living
     power remake us,
self on the cross and Christ
      upon the throne;
     past put behind us, for the
           future take us,
     Lord of our lives, to live for
            Christ alone.
