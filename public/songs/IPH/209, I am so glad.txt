 IPH 209
I am so glad
  I am so glad that our Father in
                heaven
tells of His love in the book He has
                 given:
wonderful things in the Bible I see;
 this is the dearest, that God loves
                   me.
I am so glad that Jesus loves me,
  Jesus loves me, Jesus loves me,
I am so glad that Jesus loves me,
       Jesus loves even me
Though I forget Him, and wander
               away,
 He’ll always love me wherever I
                stray;
back to His dear loving arms do I
                 flee,
when I remember that Jesus loves
                 me.
I am so glad that Jesus loves me,
  Jesus loves me, Jesus loves me,
I am so glad that Jesus loves me,
       Jesus loves even me
 O if there is only one song I can
                 sing,
when in his beauty I see the great
                 King,
 this shall my song in eternity be,
O what a wonder Jesus loves me
I am so glad that Jesus loves me,
  Jesus loves me, Jesus loves me,
I am so glad that Jesus loves me,
       Jesus loves even me
If one should ask of me: How can I
                  tell?
   Glory to Jesus, I know very well;
  God’s Holy Spirit with mine does
                agree,
  constantly witnessing Jesus loves
                  me.
I am so glad that Jesus loves me,
  Jesus loves me, Jesus loves me,
I am so glad that Jesus loves me,
       Jesus loves even me
