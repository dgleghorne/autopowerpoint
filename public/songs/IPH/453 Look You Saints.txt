  IPH 453
Look You Saints
  Look, you saints, the sight is
            glorious,
  See the Man of sorrows now;
From the fight returned victorious,
  Every knee to Him shall bow.
Crown Him, crown Him, crown
      Him, crown Him;
crowns befit the Victor’s brow.
Crown the Saviour, angels, crown
              Him!
 Rich the trophies Jesus brings;
 On the seat of power enthrone
               Him
 While the vault of heaven rings.
 Crown Him, crown Him, crown
       Him, crown Him;
crown the Saviour King of kings.
 Sinners in derision crowned Him,
Mocked the dying Saviour’s claim;
 Saints and angels crowd around
                Him,
sing His triumph, praise His name:
 Crown Him, crown Him, crown
       Him, crown Him;
spread abroad the Victor’s fame.
Hear the shout as He is greeted,
  hear those loud triumphant
            chords!
 Jesus Christ in glory seated –
  O what joy the sight affords!
Crown Him, crown Him, crown
        Him, crown Him;
King of kings, and Lord of lords!
