    IPH 426
We Sing The Praise
 We sing the praise of Him who
             died,
of Him who died upon the cross;
 the sinner’s hope though all
             deride,
for this we count the world but
              loss.
Inscribed upon the cross we see
 in shining letters, ‘God is love’;
He bears our sins upon the tree;
He brings us mercy from above.
 The cross! it takes our guilt
            away;
it holds the fainting spirit up;
it cheers with hope the gloomy
              day,
and sweetens every bitter cup;
It makes the coward spirit brave,
  and nerves the feeble arm for
              fight;
it takes its terror from the grave,
 and gilds the bed of death with
                light:
The balm of life, the cure of woe,
 the measure and the pledge of
               love,
    the sinner’s refuge here below,
      the angels’ theme in heaven
                 above.
