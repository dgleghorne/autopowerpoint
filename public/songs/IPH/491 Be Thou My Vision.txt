     IPH 491
Be Thou My Vision
Be Thou my vision, O Lord of my
              heart,
naught be all else to me, save that
            Thou art;
Thou my best thought in the day
         and the night,
waking or sleeping, Thy presence
            my light.
Be Thou my wisdom, be Thou my
            true word,
 I ever with thee, and Thou with
            me, Lord;
Thou my great father and I Thy
          true heir;
 Thou in me dwelling, and I in
          Thy care.
  Be Thou my breast-plate, my
      sword for the fight;
be Thou my armour, and be Thou
          My might;
Thou my soul’s shelter, and Thou
         my high tower,
 raise Thou me heavenward, O
       power of my power
 Riches I heed not, nor vain
       empty praise,
Thou mine inheritance through
        all my days;
Thou, and Thou only, the first in
           my heart,
   High King of heaven, my
      Treasure Thou art!
 High King of heaven, when the
          battle is done,
grant heaven’s joy to me, O bright
          heaven’s Sun!
   Christ of my own heart, whatever
                 befall,
   still be my vision, O ruler of all.
