       IPH 4
Lord, For tomorrow
 Lord, for tomorrow and its needs
           I do not pray.
Keep me, my God, from stain of sin
           just for today.
  Let me both diligently work
        and duly pray.
Let me be kind in word and deed
         just for today.
Let me no wrong or idle word
       unthinking say;
 but set a seal upon my lips
        just for today.
   And if today my tide of life
        should ebb away,
give me the grace of peace divine,
        dear Lord, today.
       So for tomorrow and its needs
                I do not pray;
      but keep me, guide me, love me,
                     Lord,
                just for today.
