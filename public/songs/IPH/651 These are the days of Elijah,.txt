These Are The Days Of Elijah
  These are the days of Elijah,
declaring the word of the Lord;
 and these are the days of Your
         servant Moses,
  righteousness being restored.
And though these are days of great
                 trial,
of famine and darkness and sword,
 still, we are the voice in the desert
                crying,
  'Prepare ye the way of the Lord.'
 Behold, He comes riding on the
              clouds,
Shining like the sun at the trumpet
                call;
  lift your voice, it's the year of
              jubilee,
out of Zion's hill salvation comes.
  These are the days of Ezekiel,
the dry bones becoming as flesh;
  and these are the days of your
         servant, David,
  rebuilding a temple of praise.
These are the days of the harvest,
  the fields are as white in the
              world,
and we are the labourers in Your
            vineyard,
 declaring the word of the Lord!
 Behold, He comes riding on the
              clouds,
Shining like the sun at the trumpet
                call;
  lift your voice, it's the year of
              jubilee,
out of Zion's hill salvation comes.
