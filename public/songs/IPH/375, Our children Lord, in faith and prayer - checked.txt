Our Children, Lord
Our children, Lord, in faith and
            prayer
  we bring before Your face;
let them Your covenant mercies
             share
 and save them by Your grace.
In early days their hearts secure
    from evil ways, we pray;
and let them to life’s end endure
    by walking in Your way.
We do not ask for wealth or fame
 for them in this world’s strife;
we ask, in Your almighty Name:
    ‘Give them eternal life!’
       Before them let their parents live
            in godly faith and fear;
       then, Lord, to heaven their souls
                    receive
        and bring their children there.
