    IPH 2
Lord As I Wake
   Lord, as I wake I turn to You,
Yourself the first thought of my day;
my King, my God, whose help is sure,
 Yourself the help for which I pray.
 There is no blessing, Lord, from You
for those who make their will their way,
 no praise for those who will not praise,
  no peace for those who will not pray.
   Your loving gifts of grace to me,
   those favours I could never earn,
call for my thanks in praise and prayer,
      call me to love you in return.
   Lord make my life a life of love,
     keep me from sin in all I do;
  Lord, make Your law my only law,
  Your will my will, for love of You.
