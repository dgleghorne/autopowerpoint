When Noah built a great big boat
When Noah built a great big boat,
his neighbours thought it would
           never float.
The rain came down and flooded
            the land,
    but God used it for good.
When Joseph was a young man,
 his brothers saw a caravan;
 he went to Egypt as a slave,
  but God used it for good.
When God called Jonah to come and
               serve,
  then Jonah ran without a word.
The big fish came and saved his life,
     and God used it for good.
When Jesus came to Bethlehem,
He came to give His life for men:
He hung and died upon the cross,
    but God used it for good.
We too have troubles come our way,
 we too have problems every day;
   we never know and we donâ€™t
           understand,
   but God will use it for good.
