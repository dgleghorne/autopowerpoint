         IPH 51
Come, You Thankful People
Come, you thankful people come,
 raise the song of harvest home!
     all is safely gathered in
  now before the storms begin:
   God our maker will provide
   for our needs to be supplied;
come, with all His people, come,
 raise the song of harvest home!
All the world is God’s own field,
 harvests for His praise to yield;
wheat and weeds together sown
  here for joy or sorrow grown:
 first the blade and then the ear,
 then the full corn shall appear-
  Lord of harvest, grant that we
wholesome grain and pure may be.
For the Lord our God shall come
and shall bring His harvest home;
  He Himself, on that great day,
worthless things shall take away,
give His angels charge at last
in the fire the weeds to cast,
 but the fruitful ears to store
  in His care for evermore.
 Even so, Lord, quickly come –
bring Your final harvest home!
   Gather all Your people in
free from sorrow, free from sin,
      there together purified,
    ever thankful at Your side –
 come, with all Your angels, come,
 bring that glorious harvest home!
