  IPH 199
All My Days
All my days I will sing this song of
            gladness,
 give my praise to the fountain of
             delights;
for in my helplessness You heard
             my cry,
and waves of mercy poured down
           on my life.
  I will trust in the cross of my
            Redeemer,
I will sing of the blood that never
                fails,
 of sins forgiven, of conscience
            cleansed,
of death defeated and life without
               end.
 Beautiful Saviour,
Wonderful Counsellor,
 clothed in majesty,
   Lord of history,
You’re the Way, the Truth,
         the Life.
  Star of the morning,
  glorious in holiness,
you’re the risen one,
heaven’s champion,
   and You reign,
 You reign over all!
I long to be where the praise is
         never-ending,
yearn to dwell where the glory
          never fades,
where countless worshippers will
         share one song,
and cries of ‘Worthy’ will honour
            the Lamb!
 Beautiful Saviour,
Wonderful Counsellor,
 clothed in majesty,
   Lord of history,
You’re the Way, the Truth,
         the Life.
  Star of the morning,
  glorious in holiness,
                 you’re the risen one,
                 heaven’s champion,
                    and You reign,
                  You reign over all!
