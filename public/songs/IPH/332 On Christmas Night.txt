    IPH 332
On Christmas Night
On Christmas night all Christians
               sing
to hear the news the angels bring:
on Christmas night all Christians
               sing
to hear the news the angels bring:
 news of great joy, news of great
             mirth,
news of our merciful King’s birth.
Then why should men on earth be
             so sad,
since our Redeemer made us glad,
then why should we on earth be so
              sad,
since our Redeemer made us glad,
When from our sin He set us free,
  All for to gain our liberty.
When sin departs before His grace,
 then life and health come in its
              place;
when sin departs before His grace,
 then life and health come in its
              place;
 heaven and earth with joy may
                sing,
all for to see the new-born King.
All out of darkness we have light,
 which made the angels sing this
               night:
all out of darkness we have light,
 which made the angels sing this
               night:
 “Glory to God, on earth be peace;
 goodwill to all shall never cease.”
