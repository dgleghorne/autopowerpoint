     IPH 42
Fill Your Hearts
Fill your hearts with joy and
          gladness,
sing and praise your God and
            mine!
  Great the Lord in love and
           wisdom,
  might and majesty divine!
  He who framed the starry
          heavens
knows and names them as they
           shine.
Praise the Lord, His people,
        praise Him!
Wounded souls His comfort
           know;
those who fear Him find His
          mercies,
 peace for pain and joy for woe;
 humble hearts are high exalted,
human pride and power laid low.
Praise the Lord for times and
           seasons,
cloud and sunshine, wind and
             rain;
 spring to melt the snows of
            winter
   till the waters flow again;
    grass upon the mountain
             pastures,
golden valleys thick with grain.
Fill your hearts with joy and
          gladness,
peace and plenty crown your
            days;
 Love His laws, declare His
        judgements,
    walk in all His words and ways;
       He and Lord and we His
                children:
      praise the Lord, all people,
                 praise!
