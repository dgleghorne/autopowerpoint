  IPH 568
Seek Ye First
Seek ye first the Kingdom of God,
      and His righteousness,
and all these things shall be added
              unto you
          Allelu, alleluia.
Alleluia, alleluia,
alleluia, alleluia!
Man shall not live by bread alone,
       but by every word,
that proceeds from the mouth of
              God.
         Allelu, alleluia.
Alleluia, alleluia,
alleluia, alleluia!
Ask and it shall be given unto you,
     seek and you shall find,
knock and the door shall be opened
             unto you.
         Allelu, alleluia.
                     Alleluia, alleluia,
                     alleluia, alleluia!
