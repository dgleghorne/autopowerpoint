       IPH 176
Jesus Stand Among Us
Jesus, stand among us
 in Your risen power;
let this time of worship
  be a hallowed hour.
 Breathe the Holy Spirit
     into every heart;
bid the fears and sorrows
 from each soul depart.
   Thus with quickened footsteps
       weâ€™ll pursue our way,
     watching for the dawning
          of eternal day.
