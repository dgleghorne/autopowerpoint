   IPH 475
O Breath Of Life
O Breath of life, come sweeping
          through us,
revive Your Church with life and
             power;
O Breath of life, come, cleanse,
           renew us,
and fit Your Church to meet this
              hour.
   O Wind of God, come bend us,
               break us,
  till humbly we confess our need;
then in Your tenderness remake us,
  revive, restore, for this we plead.
O Breath of love, come breathe
          within us,
renewing thought and will and
             heart;
Come, Love of Christ, afresh to
           win us,
 revive Your Church in every
            part.
 Revive us, Lord! Is zeal
          abating
while harvest fields are vast
        and white?
  Revive us, Lord, the world is
            waiting,
equip Your Church to spread the
              light.
