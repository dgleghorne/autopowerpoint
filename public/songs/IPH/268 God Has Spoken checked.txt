God Has Spoken
    God has spoken – by His
           prophets ,
  spoken His unchanging word;
each from age to age proclaiming
God the one, the righteous Lord;
   in the world’s despair and
             turmoil
 one firm anchor still holds fast:
God is King, His throne eternal,
God the first and God the last.
  God has spoken – by Christ
              Jesus,
   Christ, the everlasting Son;
brightness of the Father’s glory,
   with the Father ever one:
spoken by the Word incarnate,
  Life, before all time began,
   Light of light, to earth
        descending,
God, revealed as Son of Man.
 God is speaking – by His Spirit
  speaking to our hearts again;
in the age-long word expounding
God’s own message, now as then.
 Through the rise and fall of
           nations
one sure faith is standing fast:
   God abides, His word
        unchanging,
God the first and God the last.
