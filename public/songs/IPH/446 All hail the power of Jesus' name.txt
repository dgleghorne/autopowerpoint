All Hail the Power of Jesus’
           Name!
All hail the power of Jesus’ name!
     Before Him angels fall,
   bring forth the royal diadem
and crown Him, crown Him, crown
             Him,
      crown Him Lord of all.
 Crown Him, you martyrs of our
               God,
      who for His justice call,
exalt the One whose path you trod,
and crown Him, crown Him, crown
             Him,
      crown Him Lord of all.
Descendants of His chosen race,
 redeemed from Adam’s fall,
hail Him who saves you by His
            grace,
and crown Him, crown Him, crown
             Him,
      crown Him Lord of all.
Let every people, nation, tribe,
    on this terrestrial ball,
  to Him all majesty ascribe
and crown Him, crown Him, crown
             Him,
      crown Him Lord of all.
