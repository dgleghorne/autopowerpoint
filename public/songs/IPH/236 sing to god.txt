Sing To God
  Sing to God new songs of
          worship -
all His deeds are marvellous;
He has brought salvation to us
 with His hand and holy arm:
 He has shown to all the nations
righteousness and saving power;
He recalled His truth and mercy
      to His people Israel.
Sing to God new songs of worship
                 -
    earth has seen His victory;
  let the hands of earth be joyful
 praising Him with thankfullness;
Sound upon the harp with praises,
    play to Him with melody;
   let the trumpets sound His
             triumph,
 show your joy to God the King!
Sing to God new songs of worship
                  -
  let the sea now make a noise;
   all on earth and in the waters
 sound your praises to the Lord;
  Let the hills rejoice together,
 let the rivers clap their hands,
   for with righteousness and
              justice
He will come to judge the earth.
