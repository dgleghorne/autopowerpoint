What A Friend We Have In Jesus
What a friend we have in Jesus, all
   our sins and griefs to bear!
    What a privilege to carry
  everything to God in prayer!
O what peace we often forfeit,
O what needless pain we bear –
  all because we do not carry
 everything to God in prayer!
Have we trials and temptations?
  Is there trouble anywhere?
We should never be discouraged:
 take it to the Lord in prayer!
 Can we find a friend so faithful,
  who will all our sorrows share?
Jesus knows our every weakness –
   take it to the Lord in prayer!
Are we weak and heavy-laden,
burdened with a load of care?
   Jesus only is our refuge,
 take it to the Lord in prayer!
        Do your friends despise,
               forsake you?
      Take it to the Lord in prayer!
       In His arms He’ll take and
                shield you,
     you will find His comfort there.
