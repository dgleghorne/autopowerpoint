   IPH 414
Man of Sorrows
  Man of Sorrow! What a
           name
 For the Son of God, who
           came
 Ruined sinners to reclaim:
Hallelujah! What a Saviour!
  Mocked by insults harsh
         and crude,
 In my place condemned
          He stood;
Sealed my pardon with His
           blood:
Hallelujah! What a Saviour!
  Guilty, vile and helpless,
              we;
 Spotless Lamb of God was
              He:
Full atonement – can it be?
Hallelujah! What a Saviour!
  Lifted up was He to die,
 ‘It is finished!’ was His cry;
  Now in heaven, exalted
               high:
Hallelujah! What a Saviour!
       When He comes, our
            glorious King,
    All His ransomed home to
                bring;
    Then anew this song we’ll
                 sing:
   Hallelujah! What a Saviour!
Philipp Paul Bliss, 1838-1876   CCLI 128675
