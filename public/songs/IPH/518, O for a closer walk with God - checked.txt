        IPH 518
O For A Closer Walk With
          God
O for a closer walk with God,
 a constant, heavenly calm;
a light to shine upon the road
 that leads me to the Lamb!
Where is the blessing that I knew
  when first I saw the Lord?
Where is the soul-refreshing view
    of Jesus and His word?
What peaceful hours I once enjoyed!
  How sweet their memory still!
 But they have left an aching void
      the world can never fill.
 The dearest idol I have known –
     however much adored –
help me to tear it from your throne
    and worship You as Lord.
 So shall my walk be close with God,
      my mind serene and calm;
  so purer light shall mark the road
      that leads me to the Lamb.
