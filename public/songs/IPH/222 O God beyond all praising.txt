        IPH 222
O God Beyond All Praising
O God beyond all praising,
  we worship You today
and sing the love amazing
 that songs cannot repay;
  for we can only wonder
   at every gift You send,
at blessing without number
 and mercies without end:
we lift our hearts before You
 and wait upon Your word,
 we honour and adore You,
 our great and mighty Lord.
Then hear, O gracious Saviour,
   accept the love we bring,
that we who know Your favour
  may serve You as our King;
and whether our tomorrows
 be filled with good or ill,
 weâ€™ll triumph through our
           sorrows
 and rise to bless You still:
            to marvel at Your beauty
             and glory in Your ways,
              and make a joyful duty
              our sacrifice of praise!
