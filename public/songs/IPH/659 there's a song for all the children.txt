There’s A Song For All The
         Children
There’s a song for all the children
  that makes the heavens ring,
     a song that even angels
      can never, never sing;
they praise the Lord their Maker
     and see Him glorified,
  but we can call Him Saviour
    because for us He died.
There’s a place for all the children
   where Jesus reigns in love,
   a place of joy and freedom
    that nothing can remove,
 a home that is more friendly
   than any home we know,
where Jesus makes us welcome
    because He loves us so.
There’s a friend for all the children
      to guide us every day,
  whose care is always faithful
      and never fades away;
     There’s no-one else so loyal —
     His friendship stays the same;
     He knows us and He loves us,
         and Jesus is His name.
