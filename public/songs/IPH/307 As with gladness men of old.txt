          IPH 307
As With Gladness Men Of Old
 As with gladness men of old
  did the guiding star behold;
as with joy they hailed its light,
leading onward, beaming bright,
 so, most gracious God, may we
      led by You forever be.
As with joyful steps they sped,
 Saviour, to Your lowly bed,
there to bend the knee before
  You whom heaven and earth
             adore,
  so may we with one accord
seek forgiveness from our Lord.
 As they offered gifts most rare,
gold and frankincense and myrrh;
 so may we, cleansed from our
               sin,
  Lives of service now begin,
  as in love our treasure bring,
Christ, to You our heavenly King.
      Holy Jesus, every day
   keep us in the narrow way;
and, when earthly things are past,
Bring our ransomed souls at last
where they need no star to guide,
where no clouds Your glory hide.
In the heavenly country bright
  need they no created light;
You its light, its joy, its crown,
You its sun which goes not down:
  there for ever may we sing
    Hallelujahs to our King.
