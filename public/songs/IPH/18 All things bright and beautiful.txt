       IPH 18
All Things Bright And
      Beautiful
All things bright and beautiful,
 all creatures great and small,
all things wise and wonderful –
 the Lord God made them all.
 Each little flower that opens,
  each little bird that sings, –
He made their glowing colours,
   He made their tiny wings.
All things bright and beautiful,
 all creatures great and small,
all things wise and wonderful –
 the Lord God made them all.
The purple-headed mountain,
     the river running by,
 the sunset, and the morning
  that brightens up the sky,
All things bright and beautiful,
 all creatures great and small,
all things wise and wonderful –
 the Lord God made them all.
 The cold wind in the winter,
  the pleasant summer sun,
the ripe fruits in the garden, –
  He made them every one:
All things bright and beautiful,
 all creatures great and small,
all things wise and wonderful –
 the Lord God made them all.
He gave us eyes to see them,
 and lips that we might tell
how great is God Almighty,
who has made all things well.
 All things bright and beautiful,
  all creatures great and small,
 all things wise and wonderful –
  the Lord God made them all.
