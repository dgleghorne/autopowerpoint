        IPH 457
Breathe on me breath of God
 Breathe on me, breath of God:
      fill me with life anew,
that I may love as You have loved,
    and do as You would do.
Breathe on me, breath of God,
    until my heart is pure,
until my will is one with Yours
    to do and to endure.
Breathe on me, breath of God;
   be all my heartâ€™s desire,
 until this earthly part of me
glows with your heavenly fire.
            Breathe on me, breath of God;
                          so shall I never die,
           but live with You the perfect life
                               of Your eternity.
