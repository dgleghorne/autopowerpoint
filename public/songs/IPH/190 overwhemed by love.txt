Overwhelmed By Love
 Overwhelmed by love,
  deeper than oceans,
  high as the heavens.
    Ever living God.
Your love has rescued me.
   All my sin was laid
    on Your dear Son,
   Your precious One.
  All my dept He paid,
great is Your love for me.
            No one could ever
             earn Your love,
       Your grace and mercy is free.
         Lord, these words true,
         so is my love for You.
