       IPH 421
Praise To The Holiest
Praise to the Holiest in the height,
    and in the depth be praise;
 in all His words most wonderful,
     most sure in all His ways!
O Loving wisdom of our God!
when all was sin and shame,
 a second Adam to the fight
  and to the rescue came.
O wisest love! that flesh and blood,
      which did in Adam fail,
should strive afresh against the foe,
 should strive and should prevail.
O generous love! that He who came
     as Man to smite our foe,
     the double agony for us
     as man should undergo:
        And in garden secretly,
      and on the cross on high,
should teach His followers, and inspire
          to suffer and die.
    Praise to the Holiest in the height,
        and in the depth be praise;
     in all His words most wonderful,
         most sure in all His ways!
