         IPH 138
Christ Is Made Our Sure
       Foundation
Christ is made our sure foundation,
  Christ is head and cornerstone;
 chosen of the Lord and precious,
binding all the Church in one,
  holy Zion’s help for ever,
  and her confidence alone.
 To this temple, we implore you,
come, great Lord of hosts, today;
       come with all Your
          lovingkindness,
hear Your servants as they pray,
  and Your fullest benediction
   shed in all its brightest ray.
  Grant, we pray, to all Your
             people,
 all the grace they ask to gain;
what they gain from You for ever
 with the blessѐd to retain,
and hereafter in Your glory
evermore with You to reign.
Praise and honour to the Father,
 praise and honour to the Son,
praise and honour to the Spirit,
          ever Three and ever One:
         unified in power and glory,
          while unending ages run.
                    Amen.
