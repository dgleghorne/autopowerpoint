         IPH 229
Praise The Lord Of Heaven
Praise the Lord of heaven,
 praise Him in the height;
praise Him, all His angels,
praise Him, hosts of lights.
Sun and moon together,
 shining stars aflame,
planets in their courses,
  magnify His name!
Earth and ocean praise Him;
 mountains, hills and trees;
 fire and hail and tempest,
 wind and storm and seas.
Praise Him, fields and forests,
   birds on flashing wings,
praise Him, beasts and cattle,
      all created things.
  Now by prince and people
     let His praise be told;
praise Him, men and maidens;
 praise Him, young and old.
            He the Lord of glory!
           We His praise proclaim!
           High above all heavens
             magnify His name!
