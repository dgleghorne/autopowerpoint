         IPH 89
Great Is Thy Faithfulness
  Great is Thy faithfulness,
      O God my Father,
there is no shadow of turning
          with thee;
 Thou changest not, Thy
compassions they fail not,
   as Thou hast been
  Thou for ever wilt be.
Great is Thy Faithfulness!
Great is Thy Faithfulness!
  Morning by morning
   new mercies I see;
    All I have needed
Thy hand hath provided –
great is Thy faithfulness,
     Lord, unto me!
Summer and winter, and
springtime and harvest,
 sun, moon and stars in
  their courses above,
join with all nature in
 manifold witness to
Thy great faithfulness,
   mercy and love.
Great is Thy Faithfulness!
Great is Thy Faithfulness!
  Morning by morning
   new mercies I see;
    All I have needed
Thy hand hath provided –
great is Thy faithfulness,
     Lord, unto me!
  Pardon for sin and a
  peace that endureth,
Thine own dear presence
 to cheer and to guide;
strength for today and bright
     hope for tomorrow,
     blessings all mine,
  with ten thousand beside!
Great is Thy Faithfulness!
Great is Thy Faithfulness!
  Morning by morning
   new mercies I see;
            All I have needed
        Thy hand hath provided –
        great is Thy faithfulness,
             Lord, unto me!
