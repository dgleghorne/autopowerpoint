Come And Join The Celebration
Come and join the celebration,
    it’s a very special day;
 come and share our jubilation,
there’s a new King born today!
        See the shepherds
    hurry down to Bethlehem;
         Gaze in wonder
at the Son of God who lay before
              them.
Come and join the celebration,
    it’s a very special day;
 come and share our jubilation,
there’s a new King born today!
        Wise men journey,
     led to worship by a star;
         Kneel in homage,
bringing precious gifts from lands
             afar, so
Come and join the celebration,
    it’s a very special day;
 come and share our jubilation,
there’s a new King born today!
          “God is with us”
 round the world the message bring;
           He is with us,
“Welcome!” all the bells on earth are
              peeling.
Come and join the celebration,
    it’s a very special day;
 come and share our jubilation,
there’s a new King born today!
