    IPH 25
Immortal Invisible
Immortal, invisible,
   God only wise,
in light inaccessible,
 hid from our eyes,
 Unresting, unhasting,
  and silent as light,
nor wanting or wasting,
You rule in Your might,
most blessed and glorious,
  the Ancient of Days,
  almighty, victorious,
Your great name we praise.
Your justice like mountains
    high soaring above,
like torrents your fountains
   of goodness and love.
To all things, life giving,
 to great and to small,
    in all ever-living,
   the true life of all;
we blossom, then perish,
   as leaves on a tree,
 But You ever flourish
  and always shall be.
Great Father of Glory,
 pure Father of Light,
Your angels adore you,
 all veiling their sight;
         all praise we shall render;
          make this Your decree:
        that You in Your splendour
              we ever shall see.
