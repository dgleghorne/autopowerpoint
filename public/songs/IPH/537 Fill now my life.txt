     IPH 537
Fill now my life
 Fill now my life, O Lord my God,
      in every part with praise;
that my whole being may proclaim
     Your being and Your ways
Not for the lip of praise alone,
  nor yet the praising heart,
 I ask, but for a life made up
    of praise in every part.
Praise in the common things of life,
        in goings out and in;
 praise in each duty and each deed,
          exalted or unseen.
Fill every part of me with praise;
      let all my being speak
of You and of Your love, O Lord,
   poor though I be and weak.
Then, Lord, from me You shall
             receive
   the praise and glory due;
 and so shall I begin on earth
    the song for ever new.
  So shall no part of day or night
      from sacredness be free;
 but all my life, with You my God,
        in fellowship shall be.
