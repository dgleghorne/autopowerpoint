Summer Suns Are Glowing
Summer suns are glowing
      over land and sea,
   happy light is flowing
     bountiful and free;
     everything rejoices
     in the mellow rays,
all earth’s thousand voices
 swell the psalm of praise.
God’s free mercy streaming
     over all the world,
  and his banner gleaming
   everywhere unfurled.
Broad and deep and glorious
    as the heaven above,
 shines in might victorious
      His eternal love.
 Lord, upon our blindness
 Your pure radiance pour;
 for your loving-kindness
  make us love you more.
And when clouds are drifting
    dark across the sky,
  then, the veil uplifting,
    Father, be close by.
           We will never doubt you.
          though You veil Your light;
            life is dark without You,
            death with You is bright.
          Light of light, shine o’er us
               on our pilgrim way;
               still go on before us
                to the endless day.
William Walsham How, 1823-1897   CCLI 128675
