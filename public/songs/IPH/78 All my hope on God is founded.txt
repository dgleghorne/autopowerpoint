           IPH 78
All My Hope On God Is Founded
 All hope on God is founded,
 all my trust He shall renew;
He, my guide through changing
            order,
   only good and only true:
       God unknown,
          He alone,
calls my heart to be His own.
 Human pride and earthly glory,
sword and crown betray His trust;
what with care and toil we fashion,
  tower and temple, fall to dust;
     but God’s power
        hour by hour
is my temple and my tower.
God’s great goodness lasts for ever,
deep His wisdom, passing thought;
  splendour, light and life attend
               Him,
beauty springing out of naught;
           evermore
        from His store
 countless stars rise and adore.
  Day by day the almighty Giver
   grants to us His gifts of love;
in His will our souls find pleasure,
    leading to our home above:
        love shall stand
          at His hand,
joy shall wait on His command.
Still from man to God eternal
  sacrifice of praise be done;
high above all praises praising
 for the gift of Christ His son:
         hear Christ’s call,
           one and all –
   those who follow shall not fall.
