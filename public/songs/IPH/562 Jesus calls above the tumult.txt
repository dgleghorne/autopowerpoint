IPH 562
Jesus calls above the tumult
  Jesus calls above the tumult
 of our life’s wild, restless sea;
day by day His voice re-echoes,
saying, ‘Christian, follow me!’
  As of old, apostles heard it
     by the Galilean lake,
turned from home and toil and
            kindred,
 leaving all for His dear sake.
 Jesus calls us from the worship
of the vain world’s golden store,
from each rival that would claim
                us,
   saying, ‘Christian, love me
              more!’
In our joys and in our sorrows,
 days of toil and hours of ease,
   still He calls, in cares and
            pleasures,
 ‘Christian, love me more than
              these!’
Jesus calls us! By Your mercies,
Saviour, make us hear Your call,
     give to You our heart’s
            obedience,
 serve and love You best of all.
