Jesus bids us shine
  Jesus bids us shine
with a pure clear light,
   like a little candle
 burning in the night.
In this world is darkness;
      so let us shine,
you in your small corner,
      and I in mine.
   Jesus bids us shine,
   first of all for Him;
well He sees and knows it,
 if our light grows dim.
He looks down from heaven
      to see us shine,
 you in your small corner,
       and I in mine.
   Jesus bids us shine,
  then, for all around;
many kinds of darkness
in the world are found â€“
             sin and want and sorrow;
                 so we must shine,
             you in your small corner,
                   and I in mine.
