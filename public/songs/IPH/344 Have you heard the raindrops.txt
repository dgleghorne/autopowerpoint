Have You Heard The
   Raindrops?
Have you heard the raindrops
 drumming on the rooftops?
Have you heard the raindrops
  dripping on the ground?
Have you heard the raindrops
  splashing in the streams
  and running to rivers all
          around?
  There’s water, water of life,
Jesus gives us the water of life;
  there’s water, water of life,
Jesus gives us the water of life.
There’s a busy workman
  digging in the desert,
digging with a spade that
   flashes in the sun;
soon there will be water rising
        in the wellshaft,
 spilling from the bucket as it
             comes.
  There’s water, water of life,
Jesus gives us the water of life;
  there’s water, water of life,
Jesus gives us the water of life.
Nobody can live who hasn’t
        any water,
 when the land is dry then
  nothing much grows;
Jesus gives us life if we drink
      the living water,
  sing it so that everybody
            knows.
    There’s water, water of life,
  Jesus gives us the water of life;
    there’s water, water of life,
  Jesus gives us the water of life.
