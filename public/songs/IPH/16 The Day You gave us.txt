      IPH 16
The Day Thou Gave Us
  The day You gave us,
     Lord, is ended,
the darkness falls at your
        behest;
   to You our morning
    hymns ascended,
Your praise shall sanctify
        our rest.
 We thank You that Your
   Church, unsleeping
 while earth rolls onward
        into light,
through all the world her
    watch is keeping,
and rests not now by day
         or night.
As to each continent
      and island
 the dawn leads on
    another day,
the voice of prayer is
     never silent,
 nor dies the strain of
     praise away.
The sun that bids us rest is
           waking
  Your Church beneath
     the western sky,
 and hour by hour fresh
      lips are making
  Your wondrous doing
      heard on high.
      So be it, Lord: Your
      throne shall never,
       like earthâ€™s proud
     empires, pass away;
   Your kingdom stands,
     and grows for ever,
till all Your creatures own
           Your sway.
