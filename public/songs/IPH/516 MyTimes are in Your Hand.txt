My times are in Your hand
My times are in Your hand;
my God, I wish them there!
My life, my fiends, my soul,
I leave entirely to Your care
   My times are in Your hand;
      whatever they my be,
pleasing or painful, dark or bright,
    as You know best for me.
  My times are in Your hand;
  why should I doubt or fear?
My Fatherâ€™s hand will never cause
    His child a needless tear.
  My times are in Your hand;
      Jesus, the Crucified;
those hands my cruel sins had
             pierced
 are now my guard and guide.
    My times are in Your hand;
     such faith You give to me
that after death, at Your right hand
         I shall for ever be.
