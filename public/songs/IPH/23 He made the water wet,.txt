       IPH 23
He Made The Water Wet
 He made the water wet,
He made the land stay dry,
He put twinkle in the stars,
   and blue in the sky.
     And when He was sure
      it worked as it should,
God looked at His world and said,
          ‘That’s good!’
  Good, good, good! He said,
        ‘That’s good!’
Good, good, good! God looked at
      His world and said,
        ‘That’s good!’
He put a touch of wag
in a puppy dog’s tail,
Then put a little slow
  in a silly old snail.
    And when He was sure
     it worked as it should,
God looked at His world and said,
         ‘That’s good!’
  Good, good, good! He said,
        ‘That’s good!’
Good, good, good! God looked at
      His world and said,
        ‘That’s good!’
                         that’s good
                        that’s good!
