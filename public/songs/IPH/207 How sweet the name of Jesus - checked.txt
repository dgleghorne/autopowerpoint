How Sweet The Name
  How sweet the name of Jesus
             sounds
       in a believer’s ear!
It soothes our sorrows, heals our
             wounds,
    and drives away our fear.
It makes the wounded spirit whole,
   and calms the troubled breast;
    it satisfies the hungry soul,
      and gives the weary rest.
Dear Name, the rock on which I
            build,
 my shield and hiding-place;
my never-failing treasury, filled
with boundless stores of grace!
Jesus, my shepherd, brother, friend,
    my prophet, priest and king,
my Lord, my life, my way, my end -
     accept the praise I bring.
Weak is the effort of my heart,
and cold my warmest thought;
but when I see You as You are,
  I’ll praise You as I ought.
    Till then I would Your love
              proclaim
     with every fleeting breath;
  and may the music of Your name
      refresh my soul in death.
