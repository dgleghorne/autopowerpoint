    IPH 399
The Servant King
  From heaven You came, helpless
                 babe,
entered our world, Your glory veiled;
not to be served but to serve, and give
     Your life that we might live.
This is our God, the Servant King,
 He calls us now to follow Him,
   to bring our lives as a daily
             offering
 of worship to the Servant King.
  There in the garden of tears
my heavy load He chose to bear;
His heart with sorrow was torn,
“Yet not my will but yours,” He
             said.
This is our God, the Servant King,
 He calls us now to follow Him,
   to bring our lives as a daily
             offering
 of worship to the Servant King.
Come see His hands and His feet,
 the scars that speak of sacrifice,
 hands that flung stars into space
    to cruel nails surrendered.
This is our God, the Servant King,
 He calls us now to follow Him,
   to bring our lives as a daily
             offering
 of worship to the Servant King.
  So let us learn how to serve
and in our lives enthrone Him;
 each other’s needs to prefer,
 for it is Christ we’re serving.
   This is our God, the Servant King,
    He calls us now to follow Him,
      to bring our lives as a daily
                offering
    of worship to the Servant King.
