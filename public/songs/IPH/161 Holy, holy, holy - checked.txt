    IPH 161
Holy, Holy, Holy
  Holy, holy, holy, Lord God
            Almighty!
Early in the morning our song of
         praise shall be:
holy, holy, holy! - merciful and
            mighty,
God in three persons, glorious
            Trinity.
 Holy, holy, holy! All the saints
           adore You
casting down their golden crowns
      around the glassy sea,
 cherubim and seraphim falling
       down before You:
You were and are, and evermore
           shall be!
Holy, holy, holy! Though the
    darkness hide You,
though the sinful human eye
  Your glory may not see,
You alone are holy, there is none
          beside You,
 perfect in power, in love and
             purity.
   Holy, holy, holy, Lord God
           Almighty!
All Your works shall praise Your
 name, in earth and sky and sea:
 holy, holy, holy! – merciful and
              mighty,
  God in three persons, glorious
              Trinity.
