          IPH 214
Jesus Is The Name We Honour
Jesus is the name we honour;
 Jesus is the name we praise.
Majestic Name above all other
             names,
 the highest heaven and earth
            proclaim
    that Jesus is our God.
           We will glorify,
        we will lift Him high,
we will give Him honour and praise.
         We will glorify ….
   Jesus is the name we worship;
     Jesus is the name we trust.
He is the King above all other kings,
   Let all creation stand and sing
        that Jesus is our God.
           We will glorify,
        we will lift Him high,
we will give Him honour and praise.
         We will glorify ….
 Jesus is the Father’s splendour;
    Jesus is the Father’s joy.
He will return to reign in majesty,
  And every eye at last will see
      that Jesus is our God.
           We will glorify,
        we will lift Him high,
we will give Him honour and praise.
         We will glorify ….
