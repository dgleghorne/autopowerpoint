         IPH 515
My Hope is Built on Nothing
           Less
My hope is built on nothing less
    than Jesus’ blood and
       righteousness;
  no merit of my own I claim,
but wholly trust in Jesus’ name
    On Christ, the solid rock, I
              stand,
all other ground is sinking sand.
When darkness veils His lovely
              face,
I rest on His unchanging grace;
 in every high and stormy gale,
my anchor holds and will not fail.
    On Christ, the solid rock, I
              stand,
all other ground is sinking sand.
His oath, His covenant and His
              blood
 support me in the rising flood;
 when all around my soul gives
               way,
He then is all my hope and stay.
    On Christ, the solid rock, I
              stand,
all other ground is sinking sand.
When the last trumpet’s voice
         shall sound,
O may I then in Him be found,
 clothed in His righteousness
             alone.
Faultless to stand before the
            throne!
    On Christ, the solid rock, I
              stand,
all other ground is sinking sand.
