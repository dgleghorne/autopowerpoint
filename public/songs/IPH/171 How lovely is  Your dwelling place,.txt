         IPH 171
How Lovely Is Your Dwelling
          Place
How lovely is Your dwelling-
             place,
    O Lord of hosts, to me.
My soul is longing and fainting
 the courts of the Lord to see;
 My heart and flesh, they are
            singing
  for joy to the living God:
how lovely is Your dwelling-
             place,
   O Lord of hosts, to me!
 Even the sparrow finds a home
   where he can settle down;
and the swallow, she can build a
              nest
  where she may lay her young
within the courts of the Lord of
             hosts,
my King, my Lord, and my God:
   and happy are those
 who are dwelling where
the song of praise is sung!
And I’d rather be a door-keeper
     and only stay a day,
 than live the life of a sinner
   and have to stay away;
for the Lord is shining as the sun,
and the Lord, He’s like a shield –
    and no good thing does He
            withhold
  from those who walk His way
How lovely is Your dwelling-
             place,
    O Lord of hosts, to me.
My soul is longing and fainting
 the courts of the Lord to see;
      My heart and flesh, they are
                 singing
       for joy to the living God:
      how lovely is Your dwelling
                  place,
        O Lord of hosts, to me!
