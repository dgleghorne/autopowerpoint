Be Still For The Presence
 Be still, for the presence of
                the
 Lord, the Holy One, is here.
Come, bow before Him now,
                with
    reverence and fear.
 In Him no sin is found, we
              stand
      on holy ground.
Be still, for the presence of
               the
Lord, the Holy One, is here.
 Be still, for the glory of the
                Lord
    is shining all around;
He burns with holy fire, with
 splendour He is crowned.
How awesome is the sight,
                our
  radiant King of light!
Be still, for the glory of the
               Lord
  is shining all around.
Be still, for the power of the
               Lord
  is moving in this place,
He comes to cleanse and
               heal,
    to minister His grace.
 No work too hard for Him, in
   faith receive from Him;
 be still, for the power of the
                Lord
   is moving in this place.

Christ Is Made Our Sure
       Foundation
Christ is made our sure
      foundation,
  Christ is head and
     cornerstone;
chosen of the Lord and
        precious,
binding all the Church in one,
   holy Zion’s help for ever,
 and her confidence alone.
To this temple, we implore
            you,
come, great Lord of hosts,
           today;
    come with all Your
      loving kindness,
 hear Your servants as they
             pray,
and Your fullest benediction
 shed in all its brightest ray.
  Grant, we pray, to all Your
            people,
all the grace they ask to gain;
 what they gain from You for
             ever
 with the blessѐd to retain,
and hereafter in Your glory
evermore with You to reign.
  Praise and honour to the
           Father,
praise and honour to the Son,
  praise and honour to the
            Spirit,
   ever Three and ever One:
   unified in power and glory,
    while unending ages run.
              Amen.
