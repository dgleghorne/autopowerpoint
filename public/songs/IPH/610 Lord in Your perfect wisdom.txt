        IPH 610
Lord, You in your perfect
        wisdom
Lord, You in Your perfect wisdom
   times and seasons all arrange,
   working out Your changeless
              purpose
  in a world of ceaseless change;
You did form our ancient nation,
guiding it through all the days, to
    unfold in it your purpose
 to Your glory and Your praise.
  To our shores remote, benighted,
barrier of the western waves, tidings
in Your love You sent us, tidings of
         a cross that saves.
Saints and heroes strove and suffered
   here Your gospel to proclaim;
  We, the heirs of their endeavour,
    tell the honour of their name.
     Still Your ancient purpose
              standing
every change and chance above; still
  Your ancient Church remaining,
  witness to Your changeless love.
Grant us vision, Lord, and courage
   to fulfill Your work begun;
 in the Church and in the nation,
King of Kings, Your will be done.
