Shine Jesus Shine
Lord the light of Your love
         is shining,
    in the midst of the
     darkness shining:
 Jesus, Light of the world,
       shine upon us;
set us free by the truth You
       now bring us -
 shine on me, shine on me:
       Shine, Jesus, shine,
fill this land with the Father’s
              glory;
       blaze, Spirit, blaze,
      set our hearts on fire.
      Flow, river, flow,
flood the nations with grace
         and mercy;
   send forth Your word,
 Lord, and let there be light!
   Lord, I come to Your
    awesome presence,
from the shadows into Your
         radiance;
  by the blood I may enter
      Your brightness:
search me, try me, consume
      all my darkness –
 shine on me, shine on me:
       Shine, Jesus, shine,
fill this land with the Father’s
              glory;
       blaze, Spirit, blaze,
      set our hearts on fire.
      Flow, river, flow,
flood the nations with grace
         and mercy;
   send forth Your word,
 Lord, and let there be light!
As we gaze on Your kingly
        brightness
so our faces display Your
         likeness,
ever changing from glory
         to glory:
 mirrored here, may our
  lives tell Your story –
shine on me, shine on me:
       Shine, Jesus, shine,
fill this land with the Father’s
              glory;
       blaze, Spirit, blaze,
      set our hearts on fire.
      Flow, river, flow,
flood the nations with grace
         and mercy;
   send forth Your word,
 Lord, and let there be light!
