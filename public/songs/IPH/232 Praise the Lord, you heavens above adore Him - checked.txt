           IPH 232
Praise The Lord, You Heavens,
         Adore Him
 Praise the Lord, you heavens, adore
                Him,
Praise Him, angels in the height! Sun
   and moon, rejoice before Him;
 praise Him, all you stars and light!
  Praise the Lord, for He has
            spoken:
worlds His mighty voice obeyed;
   laws, which never shall be
             broken,
for their guidance He has made.
 Praise the Lord, for He is
          glorious!
Never shall His promise fail.
   God has made His saints
          victorious,
sin and death shall not prevail.
    Praise the God of our salvation!
       Hosts on high, His power
               proclaim;
   heaven and earth and all creation,
     praise and glorify His name!
