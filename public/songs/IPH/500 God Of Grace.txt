God of Grace
God of Grace, amazing wonder,
     irresistible and free;
   oh. the miracle of mercy
  Jesus reaches down to me.
  God of grace, I stand in wonder
    as my God restores my soul.
His own blood has paid my ransom;
 awesome cost to make me whole.
God of Grace who loved and knew
               me
  long before the world began;
   sent my saviour down from
            Heaven:
  perfect God and perfect man.
 God of Grace, I trust in Jesus;
   I’m accepted as His own.
Every day His grace sustains me
    as I lean on Him alone.
God of Grace, I stand astounded,
 cleansed, forgiven and secure.
All my fears are now confounded
    and my hope is ever sure.
  God of Grace, now crowned in
              glory
  where one day I’ll see your face;
    and forever I’ll adore You
    in Your everlasting Grace.
