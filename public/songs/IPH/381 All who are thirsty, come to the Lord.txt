IPH 381
All who are thirsty
All who are thirsty, come to the
             Lord,
all who are hungry, feed on His
             word;
buy without paying, food without
              price,
  eat with thanksgiving God’s
            sacrifice.
Why spend your money, yet have
           no bread;
why work for nothing? Trust God
            instead!
 He will provide you richest of
             food:
come to the waters, drink what is
             good.
 Call on God’s mercy while He is
              near,
turn from your evil, come without
              fear;
ask Him for pardon – grace will
             abound!
 This is the moment He can be
              found.
Where once were briers, flowers
          will grow,
where lives were barren, rivers
          will flow:
praise to our Saviour: grace and
            renown –
 ours is the blessing, His be the
              crown!
