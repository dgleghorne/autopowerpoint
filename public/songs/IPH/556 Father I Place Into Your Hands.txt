Father I Place Into Your Hands
 Father, I place into Your hands
    the things that I can’t do.
 Father, I place into Your hands
the times that I’ve been through.
  Father, I place into Your hands
      the way that I should go,
for I know I always can trust You.
Father, I place into Your hands
    my friends and family.
Father, I place into Your hands
  the things that trouble me.
  Father, I place into Your hands
       the person I would be,
for I know I always can trust You.
 Father, we love to seek Your face,
    we love to hear Your voice.
Father, we love to sing Your praise,
     and in Your name rejoice.
  Father, we love to walk with You
      and in Your presence rest,
for we know we always can trust You.
 Father, I want to be with You
   and do the things You do.
Father, I want to speak the words
   that You are speaking too.
  Father, I want to love the ones
     that You will draw to You,
for I know that I am one with You.
