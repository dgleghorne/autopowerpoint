     IPH 413
Make Way, Make Way
      Make way, make way,
       for Christ the King
      in splendour arrives.
Fling wide the gates and welcome
       Him into your lives.
 Make way! Make way
 for the King of kings!
 Make way! Make way
and let His kingdom in.
      He comes the broken
          hearts to heal,
      the prisoners to free;
the deaf shall hear, the lame shall
    dance, the blind shall see.
 Make way! Make way
 for the King of kings!
 Make way! Make way
and let His kingdom in.
And those who mourn with heavy
            hearts,
      who weep and sigh,
  with laughter, joy and royal
     crown Heâ€™ll beautify.
 Make way! Make way
 for the King of kings!
 Make way! Make way
and let His kingdom in.
We call you now to worship Him as
            Lord of all,
 to have no other gods but Him;
     their thrones must fall.
             Make way! Make way
             for the King of kings!
             Make way! Make way
            and let His kingdom in.
