        IPH 333
See Amid The Winter Snow
 See, amid the winter snow,
 born for us on earth below;
see, the gentle Lamb appears,
promised from eternal years:
  Hail, O ever-blessèd morn;
hail, redemption’s happy dawn;
  sing through all Jerusalem:
 ‘Christ is born in Bethlehem!’
    Low within a manger lies
  He who built the starry skies;
He who, throned in height sublime,
   reigns above the cherubim:
  Hail, O ever-blessèd morn;
hail redemption’s happy dawn;
 sing through all Jerusalem:
‘Christ is born in Bethlehem!’
Say, you humble shepherds, say
what’s your joyful news today?
Tell us why you left your sheep
 on the lonely mountain steep:
  Hail, O ever-blessèd morn;
hail redemption’s happy dawn;
 sing through all Jerusalem:
‘Christ is born in Bethlehem!’
‘As we watched at dead of night,
   all around us shone a light;
 angels singing “peace on earth”
  told us of a Saviour’s birth.’
  Hail, O ever-blessèd morn;
hail redemption’s happy dawn;
 sing through all Jerusalem:
‘Christ is born in Bethlehem!’
 Sacred infant, King most dear,
  what a tender love was here,
thus to come from highest bliss
 down to such a world as this!
  Hail, O ever-blessèd morn;
hail redemption’s happy dawn;
 sing through all Jerusalem:
‘Christ is born in Bethlehem!’
 Holy Saviour, born on earth,
teach us by Your lowly birth;
  grant that we may ever be
   taught by such humility.
     Hail, O ever-blessèd morn;
   hail redemption’s happy dawn;
    sing through all Jerusalem:
   ‘Christ is born in Bethlehem!’
