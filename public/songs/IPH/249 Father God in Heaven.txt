       IPH 249
Father God In Heaven
Father God in heaven, Lord most
              high:
hear your children’s prayer, Lord
           must high:
hallowed be Your Name, Lord
        most high —
   O Lord, hear our prayer.
May Your Kingdom come here on
            earth;
 may Your will be done here on
            earth,
as it is in heaven so on earth —
    O Lord, hear our prayer.
Give us daily bread day by day,
and forgive our sins day by day,
as we too forgive day by day —
    O Lord, hear our prayer.
 Lead us in Your way, make us
            strong;
when temptations come make us
            strong;
save us all from sin, keep us
          strong —
  O Lord, hear our prayer.
All things come from You, all are
             Yours —
 kingdom, glory, power, all are
              Yours;
   take our lives and gifts, all are
              Yours —
      O lord, hear our prayer.
