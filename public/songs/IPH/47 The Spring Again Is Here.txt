        IPH 47
The Spring Again Is Here
     The spring again is here,
life wakes from winterâ€™s gloom;
 in field and forest far and near
sweet opening flowerets bloom.
 O mystery strange and sweet,
   that life so dumbly bound
should rise, our thankful gaze to
               greet,
 and break from underground.
The morn is fresh and bright,
 the slow dark hours depart:
 let days unstained and pure
           delight
 bring sunshine to the heart.
      Lord, touch our careless eyes;
       new life, new ardour bring,
    that we may read Your mysteries,
        the wonder of your spring.
