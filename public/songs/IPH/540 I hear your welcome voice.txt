I hear Your Welcome Voice
  I hear Your welcome voice
   that calls me by Your will,
for cleansing in Your precious
              blood
 that flowed on Calvary’s hill.
       I am coming, Lord,
     coming by Your will:
wash me cleanse me, by the blood
 that flowed on Calvary’s hill.
      ‘Tis Jesus call me on
    to perfect faith and love,
to perfect hope, and peace, and
              trust,
  for earth and heaven above.
       I am coming, Lord,
     coming by Your will:
wash me cleanse me, by the blood
 that flowed on Calvary’s hill.
   ‘Tis Jesus, who confirms
   the blessed work within,
 by adding grace to welcomed
             grace,
where reigned the power of sin.
       I am coming, Lord,
     coming by Your will:
wash me cleanse me, by the blood
 that flowed on Calvary’s hill.
    All hail, atoning blood!
  All hail, redeeming grace!
 All hail, the gift of Christ our
              Lord,
our strength and righteousness!
        I am coming, Lord,
      coming by Your will:
 wash me cleanse me, by the blood
  that flowed on Calvary’s hill.
