            IPH 94
Lord, I Would Own Your Tender
             Care
Lord, I would own Your tender care,
       and all Your love I see;
 the food I eat, the clothes I wear,
       are all Your gift to me.
Lord, You preserve my life from death
       and dangers every hour;
    I cannot draw another breath
     unless You give me power.
Kind angels guard me every night,
   as round my bed they stay;
 nor am I absent from Your sight
      in darkness or by day.
  My health and friends and
         parents dear
   to me by God are given;
 I have not any blessing here
but what is sent from heaven.
 Such goodness, Lord, and constant
                 care
        a child cannot repay;
   but may it be my daily prayer
       to love You and obey.
