        IPH 3
Lord Of All Hopefulness
Lord of all hopefulness, Lord of
             all joy,
 whose trust, ever childlike, no
     cares could destroy,
be there at our waking, and give
          us, we pray,
Your bliss in our hearts, Lord, at
      the break of the day.
Lord of all eagerness, Lord of all
              faith,
whose strong hands were skilled
   at the plane and the lathe,
be there at our labours, and give
           us, we pray,
Your strength in our hearts, Lord,
     at the noon of the day.
Lord of all kindliness, Lord of all
              grace,
 Your hands swift to welcome,
     Your arms to embrace,
be there at our homing, and give
           us, we pray,
Your love in our hearts, Lord, at
       the eve of the day.
Lord of all gentleness, Lord of all
              calm,
  whose voice is contentment,
    whose presence is balm,
    be there at our sleeping, and give
               us, we pray,
    Your peace in our hearts, Lord at
           the end of the day.
