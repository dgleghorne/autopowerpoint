       IPH 82
God Is Always Near Me
     God is always near me,
        hearing what I say,
knowing all my thoughts and deeds,
       all my work and play.
  God is always near me;
    in the darkest night,
He can see me just the same
    as by mid-day light.
        God is always near me,
 though so young and small;
not a look or word or thought,
             but God knows it all.
