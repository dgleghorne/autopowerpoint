IPH 569
Soldiers of Christ, arise
and put your armour on;
strong in the strength which God
             supplies
    through His eternal Son.
  Strong in the Lord of hosts,
   and in His mighty power;
who in the strength of Jesus trusts
    is more than conqueror.
  Stand then in His great might,
  with all His strength endued;
and take, to arm you for the fight,
     the weapons of our God.
To keep your armour bright
 attend with constant care,
 still walking in your captainâ€™s
               sight
and keeping watch with prayer.
From strength to strength go on:
  wrestle and fight and pray;
tread all the powers of darkness
               down
  and win the well-fought day:
 till, having all things done
and all your conflicts past,
you overcome through Christ
           alone
 and stand complete at last.
             *
