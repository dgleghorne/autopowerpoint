God, Who Made The Earth
God, who made the earth,
 the air, the sky, the sea,
who gave the light its birth:
     He cares for me.
  God, who made the grass,
the flower, the fruit, the tree,
  the day and night to pass:
       He cares for me.
    God, who made the sun,
   the moon, the stars, is He
who, when lifeâ€™s clouds come on,
       will care for me.
 God, who made all things,
   on earth, in air, in sea,
who, changing seasons brings:
      He cares for me.
            God, who sent his son,
              to die on Calvary,
             He, if I lean on Him,
               will care for me.
