While Shepherds Watched
 While shepherds watched their
           flocks by night
     all seated on the ground,
the angel of the Lord came down
     and glory shone around.
 ‘Fear not!’ said he – for mighty
               dread
had seized their troubled mind –
‘Glad tidings of great joy I bring
    to you and all mankind.’
  ‘To you in Bethlehem this day
      is born of David’s line
a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord,
    and this shall be the sign:’
‘The heavenly Babe you there shall
                 find
     to human view displayed,
 all simply wrapped in swaddling
               clothes
       and in a manger laid.’
Thus spoke the seraph, and at once
     appeared a shining throng
 of angels praising God, who thus
    addressed their joyful song:
    ‘All glory be to God on high,
      and to the earth be peace!
   Goodwill henceforth from highest
               heaven
       begin and never cease.’
