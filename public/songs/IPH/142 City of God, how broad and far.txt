           IPH 142
City of God, how broad and far
  City of God, how broad and far
  outspread your walls sublime!
The true your chartered freemen are
      of every age and clime:
One holy Church, one army strong,
    one steadfast, high intent;
 one working band, one harvest-
              song,
      one King omnipotent.
How purely has your speech come
             down
  from earth’s primeval youth!
 How grandly has your empire
             grown
   of freedom, love and truth!
 How gleam your watch-fires
       through the night
    with never-fainting ray!
How rise your towers, serene and
             bright,
   to meet the dawning day!
In vain the surge’s angry shock,
   in vain the drifting sands:
unharmed upon the eternal rock
     the eternal city stands.
