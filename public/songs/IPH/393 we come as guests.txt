       IPH 393
We Come As Guests Invited
  We come as guests invited
   when Jesus bids us dine,
His friends on the earth united
 to share the bread and wine;
the bread of life is broken,
 the wine is freely poured
  for us, in solemn token
 of Christ our dying Lord.
  We eat and drink, receiving
from Christ the grace we need,
  and in our hearts believing
   on Him by faith we feed;
with wonder and thanksgiving
 for love that knows no end,
    we find in Jesus living
   our ever-present friend.
One bread is ours for sharing,
   one single fruitful vine,
   our fellowship declaring
 renewed in bread and wine:
     renewed, sustained and given
        by token, sign and word,
     the pledge and seal of heaven,
      the love of Christ our Lord.
