I Will Sing the Wondrous Story
 I will sing the wondrous story
of the Christ who died for me –
how He left the realms of glory
    for the cross on Calvary.
Yes, I’ll sing the wondrous story
of the Christ who died for me –
 sing it with His saints in glory,
   gathered by the crystal sea.
 I was lost: but Jesus found me,
found the sheep that went astray,
 raised me up and gently led me
    back into the narrow way.
Days of darkness still may meet
              me,
 sorrow’s path I oft may tread;
but His presence still is with me,
  by His guiding hand I’m led.
 He will keep me till the river
   rolls its waters at my feet:
then He’ll bear me safely over,
 made by grace for glory meet.
    Yes, I’ll sing the wondrous story
    of the Christ who died for me –
     sing it with His saints in glory,
       gathered by the crystal sea.
