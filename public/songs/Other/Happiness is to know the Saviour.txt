Happiness is to know the Saviour
Happiness is to know the Saviour
 Living a life within his favour
Having a change is my behaviour
     Happiness is the Lord
 Happiness is a new creation
Jesus and me in close relation
Having a part in his salvation
    Happiness is the Lord
     Real joy is mine
No matter if teardrops start
  I’ve found the secret
  It’s Jesus in my heart
   Happiness is to be forgiven
 Living a life that’s worth living
Taking a trip that leads to heaven
      Happiness is the Lord
      Happiness is the Lord
