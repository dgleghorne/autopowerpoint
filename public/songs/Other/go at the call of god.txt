Go At The Call Of God
    Go at the call of God
    To call to follow on,
  To leave security behind
And go where Christ has gone.
   Go in the name of God,
The name of Christ you bear;
Take up the Cross, its victim’s
             love
 With all the world to share.
    Go in the love of God,
 Explore its depth and height.
Held fast by love that cares, that
              heals,
   In love walk in the light.
  Go in the strength of God,
 In weakness prove God true.
The strength that dares to love
          and serve
   God will pour out in you.
   Go with the saints of God
   Our common life upbuild
That daily as we walk God’s way
  We may with love be filled.
   O God, to you we come,
   Your love alone to know,
Your name to own, your strength
            to prove
     and at your call to go.
