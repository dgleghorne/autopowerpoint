Hear The Call Of The Kingdom
Hear the call of the kingdom
 Lift your eyes to the King
Let His song rise within you
   As a fragrant offering
 Of how God rich in mercy
 Came in Christ to redeem
All who trust in His unfailing
           grace
Hear the call of the Kingdom
  To be children of light
 With the mercy of heaven
   The humility of Christ
Walking justly before Him
  Loving all that is right
That the life of Christ may
    shine through us
King of Heaven we will answer
             the call
We will follow bringing hope to
            the world
Filled with passion, filled with
      power to proclaim
  Salvation in Jesus' name
Hear the call of the Kingdom
   To reach out to the lost
With the Father's compassion
 In the wonder of the cross
     Bringing peace and
         forgiveness
  And a hope yet to come
Let the nations put their trust
            in Him
King of Heaven we will answer
             the call
We will follow bringing hope to
            the world
King of Heaven we will answer
             the call
We will follow bringing hope to
            the world
Filled with passion, filled with
      power to proclaim
  Salvation in Jesus' name
King of Heaven we will answer
             the call
We will follow bringing hope to
            the world
    Filled with passion, filled with
          power to proclaim
      Salvation in Jesus' name.
    Salvation in Jesus' name (x2)
