Faithful One So Unchanging
     Faithful One so unchanging
Ageless One youâ€™re my rock of peace
     Lord of all I depend on you
  I call out to you again and again
  I call out to you again and again
 You are my rock in times of trouble
  You lift me up when I fall down
All through the storm your love is the
               anchor
       My hope is in you alone.
