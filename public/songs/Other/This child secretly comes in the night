This child secretly comes in the night

This child secretly comes in the night 
Oh this Child, hiding a heavenly light 
Oh this Child, coming to us like a stranger 
This heavenly Child
This Child, heaven come down now 
To be with us here 
Heavenly love and mercy appear 
Softly in awe and wonder come near 
to this heavenly Child
This Child, rising on us like the sun 
Oh this child, given to light everyone 
Oh this Child, guiding our feet on the pathway 
To peace on earth
This Child, heaven come down now 
To be with us here 
Heavenly love and mercy appear 
Softly in awe and wonder come near 
to this heavenly Child
This Child, raising the humble and poor 
Oh this Child, making the proud ones to fall 
This Child, filling the hungry with good things 
This heavenly Child
This Child, heaven come down now 
To be with us here 
Heavenly love and mercy appear 
Softly in awe and wonder come near 
to this heavenly Child
