• God sent His son, they called
           Him, Jesus;
   He came to love, heal and
             forgive;
  He lived and died to buy my
            pardon,
   An empty grave is there to
     prove my Saviour lives!
              16/10/11
Because He lives, I can face
          tomorrow,
 Because He lives, all fear is
             gone;
Because I know He holds the
            future,
 And life is worth the living,
   Just because He lives!

• How sweet to hold a newborn
               baby,
  And feel the pride and joy he
               gives;
     But greater still the calm
            assurance:
  This child can face uncertain
     days because He Lives!
              16/10/11
Because He lives, I can face
          tomorrow,
 Because He lives, all fear is
             gone;
Because I know He holds the
            future,
 And life is worth the living,
   Just because He lives!

• And then one day, I'll cross the
                      river,
  I'll fight life's final war with pain;
   And then, as death gives way
                  to victory,
   I'll see the lights of glory and I'll
               know He lives!

Because He lives, I can face

 Because He lives, all fear is
             gone;
Because I know He holds the
            future,
 And life is worth the living,
   Just because He lives!
