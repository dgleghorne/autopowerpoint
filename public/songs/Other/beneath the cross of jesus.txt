Beneath The Cross Of Jesus
Beneath the cross of Jesus
 I find a place to stand,
And wonder at such mercy
  That calls me as I am;
 For hands that should discard me
Hold wounds which tell me, "Come."
     Beneath the cross of Jesus
     My unworthy soul is won.
 Beneath the cross of Jesus
  His family is my own—
Once strangers chasing selfish
          dreams,
Now one through grace alone.
 How could I now dishonour
The ones that You have loved?
  Beneath the cross of Jesus
See the children called by God.
 Beneath the cross of Jesus—
 The path before the crown—
  We follow in His footsteps
Where promised hope is found.
How great the joy before us
  To be His perfect bride;
 Beneath the cross of Jesus
We will gladly live our lives.
