I hear Thy welcome voice
 I hear Thy welcome voice,
 That calls me, Lord, to Thee,
For cleansing in Thy precious
            blood
    That flowed on Calvary
     I am coming, Lord,
     Coming now to Thee:
Wash me, cleanse me in the blood
     That flowed on Calvary.
    'Tis Jesus calls me on
    to perfect faith and love,
to perfect hope and peace and
              trust,
  for earth and heav'n above.
     I am coming, Lord,
     Coming now to Thee:
Wash me, cleanse me in the blood
     That flowed on Calvary.
   'Tis Jesus who confirms
    the blessed work within,
 by adding grace to welcomed
             grace
where reigned the power of sin
     I am coming, Lord,
     Coming now to Thee:
Wash me, cleanse me in the blood
     That flowed on Calvary.
  All hail! atoning blood!
 All hail! redeeming grace!
All hail! the gift of Christ our
             Lord,
      our Strength and
       Righteousness.
     I am coming, Lord,
     Coming now to Thee:
Wash me, cleanse me in the blood
     That flowed on Calvary.
