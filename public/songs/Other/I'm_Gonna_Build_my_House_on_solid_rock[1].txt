I’m Gonna Build my House on solid
               rock
I’m Gonna Build my House on solid
                rock
Gonna build my house on solid rock
so I won’t wake up to a nasty shock
To find nothing but a pile of rubble.
  Don’t want to build a house on
   foundations that will wobble
Don’t want to build a house with any
            dodgy bricks
Don’t want to build a house that will
         shake like a jelly
  I want to shout out loud of this
      house you can be proud
I’m Gonna Build my House on solid
                rock
Gonna build my house on solid rock
So I won’t wake up to a nasty shock
To find nothing but a pile of rubble.
Jesus said “ take my words and put
         them into action”
   Make these words; He said
     “foundations in your life”
Build with care or else your house
         will surely tumble
And it’s not a clever trick to own a
           pile of bricks
I’m Gonna Build my House on solid rock
  Gonna build my house on solid rock
  So I won’t wake up to a nasty shock
   To find nothing but a pile of rubble
Jesus said “take my words and
     put them into action”
  Make these words; He said
   “foundations in your life”
And when the river comes and
    crashes up against you
 You won’t get washed away
 instead you’ll cheer and say
I’m Gonna Build my House on solid
                rock
Gonna build my house on solid rock
So I won’t wake up to a nasty shock
 To find nothing but a pile of rubble
