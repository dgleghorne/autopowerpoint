Humble King
  Oh kneel me down again
     Here at Your feet
Show me how much You love
         Humility
  Oh spirit be the star
   That leads me to
The humble heart of love
      I see in You
You are the God of the broken
   The friend of the weak
  You wash the feet of the
            weary
 Embrace the ones in need
And I want to be like You
         Jesus
To have this heart in me
 You are the God of the
        humble
You are the humble King
