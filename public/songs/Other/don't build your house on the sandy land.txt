Don’t Build Your House
 On The Sandy Land
 Don’t build your house on the
          sandy land
Don’t build it too near the shore
Well it might look kind of nice
But you’ll have to build it twice
 Oh you’ll have to build you
      house once more.
You better build your house upon
              a rock
 Make a good foundation on a
            solid spot
Oh the storms may come and go
 But the peace of God you will
             know.
