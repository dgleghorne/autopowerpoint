God forgave my sin in Jesus' name;
I've been born again in Jesus' name,
 and in Jesus' name I come to you
 to share His love as He told me to.
He said: 'Freely, freely you have received,
            freely, freely give;
go in My name, and because you believe,
       others will know that I live.'
 All power is given in Jesus' name
in earth and heaven in Jesus' name;
 and in Jesus' name I come to you
to share His power as He told me to.
He said: 'Freely, freely you have received,
            freely, freely give;
go in My name, and because you believe,
       others will know that I live.'
