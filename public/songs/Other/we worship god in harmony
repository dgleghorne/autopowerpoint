We worship God in harmony

We worship God in harmony with hearts in full accord; 
we share one Spirit, hope and faith, 
one Father and one Lord:

In Jesus Christ our Lord and king, 
in Jesus Christ our Lord, 
the Spirit makes us all as one 
in Jesus Christ our Lord.

We're children now of God by grace 
our new life has begun, 
where male and female, Greek and Jew, 
both bound and free are one.

In Jesus Christ our Lord and king, 
in Jesus Christ our Lord, 
the Spirit makes us all as one 
in Jesus Christ our Lord.

We live as those whom Christ has called 
to love with Christ-like mind 
that looks towards each other's needs, 
forbearing, patient, kind.

In Jesus Christ our Lord and king, 
in Jesus Christ our Lord, 
the Spirit makes us all as one 
in Jesus Christ our Lord.

One day we'll see him face to face, 
to him we'll bow the knee; 
we'll never say goodbye again 
the best is yet to be!

In Jesus Christ our Lord and king, 
in Jesus Christ our Lord, 
the Spirit makes us all as one 
in Jesus Christ our Lord.
