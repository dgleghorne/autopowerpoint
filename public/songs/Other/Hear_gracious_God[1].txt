Hear, Gracious God!
Hear, gracious God! a sinner's cry,
 For I have nowhere else to fly;
My hope, my only hope's in You:
   O God, be merciful to me!
 To You I come, a sinner poor,
And wait for mercy at Your door;
Indeed I've nowhere else to flee;
   O God, be merciful to me!
   To You I come, a sinner weak,
  And scarce know how to pray or
              speak;
From fear and weakness set me free.
     O God, be merciful to me!
   To You I come a sinner vile,
Upon me, Lord, vouchsafe to smile;
  Mercy alone I make my plea;
    O God, be merciful to me!
 To You I come, a sinner great,
And well You know all my state;
Yet full forgiveness is with You;
  O God, be merciful to me!
  To You I come, a sinner lost,
Nor have I ought wherein to trust,
But where You are, Lord, I would
              be;
   O God, be merciful to me!
