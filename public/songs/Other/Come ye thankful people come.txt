Come ye thankful people come
Come ye thankful people come
Raise the song of harvest home
   All is safely gathered in
 Ere the winter storms begin
  God our maker doth provide
  For our wants to be supplied;
Come to God’s own temple come,
 Raise the song of harvest home.
All this world is God’s own field,
 Fruit unto His praise to yield;
Wheat and tares together sown
   Unto joy or sorrow grown:
 First the blade and then the ear,
 Then the full corn shall appear –
  Lord of harvest, grant that we
Wholesome grain and pure may be.
For the Lord our God shall come
and shall take His harvest home
 From his field shall in that day
    All offences purge away,
Give His angels charge at last
 In the fire the tares to cast,
But the fruitful ears to store
  In His garner evermore.
 Even so, Lord, quickly come –
 Bring thy final harvest home!
   Gather thou thy people in
Free from sorrow, free from sin,
    There, forever purified,
     in thy garner to abide;
Come, with all thine angels, come,
Raise the glorious harvest home.
