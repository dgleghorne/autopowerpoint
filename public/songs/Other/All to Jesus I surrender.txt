All To Jesus I Surrender
   All to Jesus I surrender,
   All to Him I freely give;
I will ever love and trust Him,
  In His presence daily live.
         I surrender all,
         I surrender all,
All to Thee, my blessed Saviour,
         I surrender all.
   All to Jesus I surrender
  Humbly at His feet I bow;
Worldly pleasures all forsaken,
 Take me Jesus, take me now
         I surrender all,
         I surrender all,
All to Thee, my blessed Saviour,
         I surrender all.
   All to Jesus I surrender
Make me Saviour wholly Thine;
 Let me feel the Holy Spirit,
Truly know that Thou art mine
         I surrender all,
         I surrender all,
All to Thee, my blessed Saviour,
         I surrender all.
     All to Jesus I surrender
   Lord I give myself to Thee,
Fill me with Thy love and power
   Let Thy blessing fall on me
         I surrender all,
         I surrender all,
All to Thee, my blessed Saviour,
         I surrender all.
  All to Jesus I surrender
Now I feel the sacred flame;
Oh, the joy of full salvation!
 Glory, Glory to His name!
         I surrender all,
         I surrender all,
All to Thee, my blessed Saviour,
         I surrender all.
