God’s People
God’s people aren’t super brave
         super heroes
They don’t have muscles from
   their heads to their toes
They’re not gladiators that’s easy
                to see
In fact it’s amazing. They are just
          like you and me.

Sometimes scared........shaking
      and a-shiv’ring........
But let’s realise we’ve got God
           on our side
  And he can do absolutely
            anything
