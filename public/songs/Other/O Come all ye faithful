O come, all ye faithful

O come, all ye faithful,
Joyful and triumphant,
O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem;
Come and behold him
Born the King of angels;
O come, let us adore him,
O come, let us adore him,
O come, let us adore him,
Christ the Lord.
God of God,
Light of Light
Lo! He abhors not the virgin’s womb;
Very God,
Begotten, not created;
O come, let us adore him,
O come, let us adore him,
O come, let us adore him,
Christ the Lord.
Sing, choirs of angels,
sing in exultation,
Sing, all ye citizens of heaven above,
“Glory to God
In the highest”:
O come, let us adore him,
O come, let us adore him,
O come, let us adore him,
Christ the Lord.
Yea, Lord we greet Thee
Born for our salvation;
Jesus to Thee be glory given!
Word of the Father, now in flesh appearing:
O come, let us adore him,
O come, let us adore him,
O come, let us adore him,
Christ the Lord.
