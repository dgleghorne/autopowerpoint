See the shepherds 
hurry down to Bethlehem;

at the Son of God who lay before them.

Wise men journey, 
led to worship by a star, 
Kneel in homage, bringing precious gifts from lands afar, 
soâ€¦

there's a new King born today!

'Welcome!' all the bells on earth are pealing.

Come and join the celebration, 
It's a very special day;
