Jesus was born at Christmas

Jesus was born at Christmas
On a very holy night
And in the sky above him
Shone the very brightest light
All of the heavenly angels
Sang a song to praise his name
They told the lowly shepherds
So they left their sheep and came.
From the east the Wise men came
Bringing gifts to share
Riches for the King of Kings
To show the Saviour that they care
Now we celebrate his birthday
In our hearts and everyday
Jesus in your humble manger
Your true love is here to stay.
