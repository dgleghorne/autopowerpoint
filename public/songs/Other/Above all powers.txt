Above All Powers
Above all powers above all kings
Above all nature and all created
            things
 Above all wisdom and all the
        ways of man
You were here before the world
            began
 Above all kingdoms above all
            thrones
Above all wonders the world has
          ever known
Above all wealth and treasures of
            the earth
There’s no way to measure what
          you’re worth
Crucified laid behind the stone
 You lived to die rejected and
       alone like a rose
Trampled on the ground you took
            the fall
  And thought of me above all.
