I Give You All The Honour
   I give You all the honour
And praise that’s due Your name
 For You are the King of glory
   The Creator of all things
    And I worship You
   I give my life to You
I fall down on my knees
    And I worship You
   I give my life to You
I fall down on my knees
As Your Spirit moves upon me now
    You meet my deepest need
  And I lift my hands up to Your
              throne
      Your mercy I receive
    And I worship You
   I give my life to You
I fall down on my knees
    And I worship You
   I give my life to You
I fall down on my knees
You have broken chains that bound
                  me
   you’ve set this captive free
I will lift my voice to praise Your
                 name
            For all eternity
    And I worship You
   I give my life to You
I fall down on my knees
    And I worship You
   I give my life to You
I fall down on my knees
