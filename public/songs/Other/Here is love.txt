Here is love
Here is love vast as the ocean
 loving kindness as the flood
  when the Prince of life our
            ransom
Shed for us His precious blood
    Who His love will not
        remember
 Who can cease to song His
          praise
 He can never be forgotten
Throughout Heaven’s eternal
           days.
On the mount of crucifixion
Fountains opened deep and
           wide
 Through the floodgates of
       God’s mercy
Flowed a vast and gracious
           tide
 Grace and love like mighty
           rivers
Poured incessant from above
 And Heaven’s peace and
       perfect justice
Kissed a guilty world in love.
