Many years ago

Many years ago
in a stable far away
Christ the Lord was born
What a joyful day!
Singing filled the air
Glory shone around
Shepherds on the hillside
were astonished by this sound.
Have no fear! Have you heard?
Christ is born today
Go and see Him lying there
In a manger filled with hay – hay!
Then the sky came alive
Angels everywhere
Singing hymns of joyful praise
to the God who sent them there.
On to Bethlehem
In a most exciting way
Shepherds went to see
Christ the Lord that day.
When they saw him there
They were filled with joy
On their knees they worshipped him
God’s special baby boy.
Have no fear! Have you heard?
Christ is born today
Go and see Him lying there
In a manger filled with hay – hay!
Then the sky came alive
Angels everywhere
Singing hymns of joyful praise
to the God who sent them there.
