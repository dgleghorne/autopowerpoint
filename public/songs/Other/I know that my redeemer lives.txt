I Know That My Redeemer
         Lives
 I know that my Redeemer lives;
What joy the blest assurance gives
He lives, He lives, who once was
              dead;
  He lives, my everlasting Head.
He lives to bless me with His love,
 He lives to plead for me above.
 He lives my hungry soul to feed,
 He lives to help in time of need.
He lives and grants me daily breath;
He lives, and I shall conquer death:
 He lives my mansion to prepare;
 He lives to bring me safely there.
 He lives, all glory to His Name!
He lives, my Saviour, still the same.
What joy the blest assurance gives
  I know that my Redeemer lives
