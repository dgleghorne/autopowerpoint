Chill of the nightfall
 Chill of the nightfall
Lamps in the windows
Letting their light fall
  clear on the snow
 Bitter December
Bids us remember
Christ in the stable
  Long long ago
Silence of midnight
 Voices of angels
Singing to bid night
 Yield to the dawn
Darkness is ended
Sinners befriended
Where in the stable
   Jesus is born
Splendour of starlight
 High on the hillside
 Faint is the far light
   Burning below
Kneeling before him
Shepherds adore him
 Christ in the stable
   Long long ago
 Glory of daybreak
Sorrows and shadows
Suddenly they break
  Forth into morn
Sing out and tell now
All shall be well now
  For in the stable
    Jesus is born.
