Psalm 24
Ye gates, lift up your heads on high;
     ye doors that last for aye,
   be lifted up, that so the King
        of glory enter may.
 But who of glory is the King?
    The mighty Lord is this;
even that same Lord that great in
             might
     and strong in battle is.
Ye gates, lift up your heads: ye
              doors,
  doors that do last for aye,
 be lifted up, that so the King
      of glory enter may.
  But who is he that is the King
      of glory? who is this?
The Lord of hosts, and none but he,
       the King of glory is.
