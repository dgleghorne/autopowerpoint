Psalm 95
First Version
O come, and let us to the Lord
   in songs our voices raise,
with joyful noise let us the rock
    of our salvation praise.
Let us before his presence come
with praise and thankful voice;
 let us sing psalms to him with
              grace,
    and make a joyful noise.
The Lordâ€™s a great God and
         great King,
    above all gods he is.
Depths of the earth are in his
            hand,
 the strength of hills is his.
To him the spacious sea belongs,
   for he the same did make;
the dry land also from his hands
    its form at first did take.
 O come and let us worship him,
    let us bow down withal,
and on our knees before the Lord
      our Maker let us fall.
