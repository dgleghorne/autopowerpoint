Psalm 116 v13-19
I’ll of Salvation
  I’ll of salvation take the cup,
  and on the Lord’s name call;
I’ll pay my vows unto the Lord
       before his people all
 Dear in his sight is his saints’ death.
       Thy servant, Lord, am I;
thy servant sure, thine handmaid’s son:
      my bands thou didst untie.
Thank-offerings I to thee will give,
   and on the Lord’s name call.
I’ll pay my vows now to the Lord
       before his people all,
within the courts of the Lord’s house,
      within the midst of thee,
         O city of Jerusalem.
     Praise to the Lord give ye.
