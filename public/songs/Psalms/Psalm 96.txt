Psalm 96 v1-7
 O sing a new song to the
              Lord:
 Sing all the earth to God.
To God sing, bless his name,
 Show still his saving health
            abroad.
 Among the nations of the
             earth
    His glory do declare;
And unto all the people show
His works that wondrous are.
 For greatâ€™s the Lord, and
          greatly he
    Is to be magnified;
Yea, worthy to be feared is
              he
  Above all gods beside.
  For all the gods are idols
             dumb
Which blinded nations fear;
 But our God is the Lord, by
             whom
The heavens created were.
 Great honour is before his
             face,
     And majesty divine;
  Strength is within his holy
            place,
And there doth beauty shine.
Do ye ascribe unto the Lord,
  Of people every tribe,
 Glory do ye unto the Lord
And mighty power ascribe.
