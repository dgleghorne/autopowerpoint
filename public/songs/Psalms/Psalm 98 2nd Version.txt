Psalm 98
2nd Version
  Sing a new song to Jehovah,
   for he wondrous things hath
             wrought;
his right hand and arm most holy
   victory to him have brought
Lo! the Lord his great salvation
openly hath now made known;
  in the sight of every nation
he his righteousness has shown.
  Mindful of his truth and mercy
  he to Israel’s house hath been;
 and the Lord our God’s salvation
all the ends of the earth have seen.
 All the earth sing to Jehovah!
 shout aloud! sing and rejoice!
With the harp sing to Jehovah!
with the harp and tuneful voice.
Sound the trumpet and the cornet,
 shout before the Lord the King;
 sea, and all its fulness, thunder;
  earth, and all its people, sing.
 Let the rivers in their gladness
clap their hands with one accord;
 let the mountains sing together
     joyfully before the Lord.
 For to judge the earth he cometh;
  and with righteousness shall he
judge the world, and all the nations
     with most perfect equity.
