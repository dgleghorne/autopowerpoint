Psalm 55
v22-end
Cast thou thy burden on the
            Lord,
 and he shall thee sustain;
  yea, he shall cause the
       righteous man
    unmoved to remain.
But thou, O God, in judgement
               just
  those men shalt overthrow,
 and in destructionâ€™s dungeon
              dark
   at last shalt lay them low;
The bloody and deceitful men
 shall not live half their days:
but upon thee with confidence
     I will depend always.
