Psalm 145 2nd version V 1-7
O Lord, thou art my God and King;
   thee will I magnify and praise:
 I will thee bless, and gladly sing
     unto thy holy name always.
 Each day I rise I will thee bless,
and praise thy name time without
               end.
Much to be praised, and great God
                is;
    his greatness none can
          comprehend.
  Race shall thy works praise unto
                race,
the mighty acts show done by thee.
I will speak of the glorious grace,
   and honour of thy majesty;
thy wondrous works I will record.
By men the might shall be extolled
 of all thy dreadful acts, O Lord;
 and I thy greatness will unfold.
   They utter shall abundantly
  the memory of thy goodness
              great;
and shall sing praises cheerfully,
 whilst they thy righteousness
              relate.
