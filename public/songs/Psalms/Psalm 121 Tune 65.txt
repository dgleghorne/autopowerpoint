Psalm 121 Tune 65
   I to the hills will lift mine eyes,
from whence doth come mine aid.
 My safety cometh from the Lord,
who heaven and earth hath made.
Thy foot heâ€™ll not let slide, nor will
  he slumber that thee keeps.
  Behold, he that keeps Israel,
  he slumbers not, nor sleeps.
The Lord thee keeps, the Lord thy
              shade
   on thy right hand doth stay:
 the moon by night thee shall not
              smite,
     nor yet the sun by day.
The Lord shall keep thy soul; he
             shall
   preserve thee from all ill.
Henceforth they going out and in
    God keep for ever will.
