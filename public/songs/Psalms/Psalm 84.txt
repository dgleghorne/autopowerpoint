Psalm 84
How lovely is thy dwelling-place,
   O Lord of hosts, to me!
 The tabernacles of thy grace
 how pleasant, Lord, they be!
My thirsty soul longs veh’mently,
 yea faints, thy courts to see;
my very heart and flesh cry out,
     O living God, for thee.
Behold, the sparrow findeth
            out
 an house wherein to rest;
the swallow also for herself
   provided hath a nest;
even thine own altars, where she
             safe
her young ones forth may bring,
 O thou almighty Lord of hosts,
   who art my God and King.
Blest are they in thy house
        that dwell,
they ever give thee praise.
   Blest is the man whose
      strength thou art,
in whose heart are thy ways:
  Who as they pass through
          Baca’s vale
  make it a place of springs;
also the rain that falleth down
   rich blessing to it brings.
