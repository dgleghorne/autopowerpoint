Psalm 23
My soul he doth restore again;
  and me to walk doth make
      within the paths of
        righteousness,
even for his own name’s sake.
  Yea, though I walk in death’s
            dark vale,
      yet will I fear none ill;
for thou art with me, and thy rod
    and staff me comfort still.
My table thou hast furnished
  in presence of my foes;
 my head thou dost with oil
           anoint,
   and my cup overflows.
Goodness and mercy all my
            life
  shall surely follow me:
  and in God’s house for
         evermore
my dwelling-place shall be.
