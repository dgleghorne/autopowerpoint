Paraphrase 2
Genesis xxviii. 20-22
O God of Bethel! By whose
hand thy people still are fed;
  who through this weary
        pilgrimage
  hast all our fathers led:
Our vows, our pray’rs, we now
           present
 before thy throne of grace:
 God of our Fathers! Be the
God of their succeeding race.
Through each perplexing path
            of life
our wand’ring footsteps guide;
  give us each day our daily
            bread,
    and raiment fit provide.
O spread thy cov’ring wings
             around,
till all our wand’rings cease,
   and at our Father’s lov’d
              abode
  our souls arrive in peace.
  Such blessings from thy
       gracious hand
 our humble pray’rs implore;
and thou shalt be our chosen
            God,
   and portion evermore.
