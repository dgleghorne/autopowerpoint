Paraphrase 32
What though no flow’rs the fig-
          tree clothe,
 though vines their fruit deny,
   the labour of the olive fail,
  and fields no meat supply?
Though from the fold, with sad
          surprise,
    my flock cut off I see;
 though famine pine in empty
            stalls,
  where herds were wont be?
   Yet in the Lord will I glad,
      and glory in his love:
in him I’ll joy, who will the God
     of my salvation prove.
   He to my tardy feet shall lend
      the swiftness of the roe;
tills, rais’d on high, I safely dwell
     beyond the reach of woe.
 God is the treasure of my soul,
     the source of lasting joy;
a joy which want shall not impair,
      nor death itself destroy.
