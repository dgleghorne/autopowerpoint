Paraphrase 30
Come let us to the Lord our
  Come, let us to the Lord OUR God
      with contrite hearts return;
  our God is gracious, nor will leave
        the desolate to mourn.
His voice commands the tempest forth
      and stills the stormy wave;
and though his arm be strong to smite,
         ‘tis also strong to save
Long hath the night of sorrow reigned,
      the dawn shall bring us light:
  God shall appear and we shall rise
       With gladness in his sight.
 Our hearts, if God we seek to know,
       shall know him, and rejoice;
  his coming like the morn shall be,
     like morning songs his voice.
 As dew upon the tender herb, diffusing
              fragrance round;
   as show’rs that usher in the spring,
      and cheer the thirsty ground:
  So shall his presence bless our souls,
         and shed a joyful light;
that hollow’d morn shall chase away the
           sorrows of the night.
