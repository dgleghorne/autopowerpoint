Paraphrase 18
 (Isaiah ii. 2-6)
Behold! The mountain of the
 Lord in latter days shall rise
 on mountain tops above the
             hills,
and draw the wond’ring eyes.
To this the joyful nations round,
all tribes and tongues shall flow;
  Up to the hill of God, they’ll
                say,
    and to his house we’ll go.
The beam that shines from Sion
                hill
    shall lighten ev’ry land;
the King who reigns in Salem’s
              tow’rs
 shall all the world command.
   Among the nations he shall
              judge;
his judgements truth shall guide;
his sceptre shall protect the just,
  and quell the sinner’s pride.
No strife shall rage, nor hostile
               feuds
  disturb those peaceful years;
to ploughshares men shall beat
           their swords,
 to pruning-hooks their spears.
No longer hosts encount’ring
             hosts
shall crowds of slain deplore:
 they hang the trumpet in the
             hall,
   and study war no more.
Come then, O house of Jacob!
            come
  to worship at his shrine;
 and, walking in the light of
            God,
  with holy beauties shine.
